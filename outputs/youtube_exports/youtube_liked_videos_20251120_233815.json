    "description": "Good Morning!! Today, I want to talk to you about the power of affirmations and how they can transform your life. Specifically, I want to share with you the amazing affirmation \"I am a magnet for wealth.\"\n\nRepeat after me: \"I am a magnet for wealth.\" Say it out loud, say it with conviction, and feel the energy of these words flowing through your body. This simple yet powerful affirmation has the ability to attract abundance and prosperity into your life.\n\nYou see, our thoughts and words have a tremendous impact on our reality. When we constantly tell ourselves that we are not good enough, that we don't deserve wealth, or that we will never be successful, we are creating a negative energy that repels abundance. On the other hand, when we affirm positive statements like \"I am a magnet for wealth,\" we are sending out a powerful message to the universe that we are open and ready to receive all the blessings that come our way.\nBut it's not just about saying the words, it's aout truly believing in them. When you say \"I am a magnet for wealth,\" you are declaring to the universe that you are worthy and deserving of abundance. You are shifting your mindset from scarcity to abundance, and that is when the magic happens.\n\nThis affirmation is not just about attracting financial wealth, it's about attracting all forms of abundance into your life. Health, happiness, love, and success are all forms of abundance that can be manifested through this powerful affirmation. By declaring that you are a magnet for wealth, you are also affirming that you are a magnet for health, happiness, and abundance in all areas of your life.\n\nSo, my dear friends, I encourage you to start your day with this powerful affirmation. Say it in the morning, say it throughout the day, and say it before you go to bed. Let it become a mantra that you repeat to yourself whenever you need a reminder of your worth and potential.\n\nRemember, you are a powerful magnet for wealth and abundance. Believe it, feel it, and watch as your life transforms in the most amazing ways. Trust in the process and have faith that the universe will bring you all that you desire.\n\nI am sending you all love, light, and abundance. Keep affirming, keep believing, and keep manifesting. You are worthy, you are deserving, and you are a magnet for wealth.

    "description": "Hello everyone! Today, I want to share with you all some amazing news - good things are happening to me! I am overflowing with joy and gratitude as I see my life transforming in the most positive ways.\n\nI have been practicing daily positive affirmations for success and positive thinking, and let me tell you, it has made all the difference. I used to be someone who constantly doubted myself and my abilities, but now I am filled with confidence and self-belief. I have learned to let go of negative thoughts and replace them with empowering affirmations.\n\nAnd the results have been incredible. Opportunities are coming my way, doors are opening, and I am achieving my goals one by one. It's like the universe is aligning with my positive mindset and bringing me all the good things I deserve.\n\nBut it's not just about external success. My inner peace and happiness have also increased tenfold. I am more content with who I am and where I am in life. I have learned to appreciate the present moment and trust in the journey.\n\nI want to encourage each and every one of you to start incorporating daily positive affirmations into your life. It may seem silly or insignificant at first, but trust me, it can truly change your life. Start by saying things like \"I am capable,\" \"I am worthy,\" \"I am deserving of all the good things coming my way.\" Repeat them every day, and watch as your mindset shifts and attracts positivity into your life.\n\nRemember, good things are always happening, even if we can't see them at the moment. Trust in the process and keep a positive outlook, and you will see the magic unfold in your life.\n\nI am so grateful for all the good things happening to me, and I know that more blessings are on the way.

In modern times, we've turned to science to explain who we are. We've learned that certain personality traits are inherited. We've discovered that our DNA is more malleable than we thought, continuing to fuel the nurture versus nature debate.\n\nWe've learned that the protein coats that regulate how our genes function, epigenes, contain ancestral memories that influence how we experience the world, and particularly how we create wellness and well-being.  When you work to shift your personal story on the quantum level, mental and emotional level, the subtle body level, and the physical level, you create a dynamic, integrated matrix that helps you shift your personal story permanently.",

And that frees you from being obsessed about them. \n\nIt allows you to do the work you need to do instead of carrying around all these dark, negative people.”\n\n - Dr. Judith Orloff, MD, New York Times bestselling author, member of the psychiatric clinical faculty at UCLA, and today’s guest on Quantum Revolution\n\nToday, Dr. Judith Orloff explores the profound connection between intuition and healing. Discover how tuning into your inner voice can guide you through life's challenges and enhance your well-being. Dr. Orloff provides insights into how empaths and highly sensitive individuals can develop their intuitive abilities to create a more fulfilling and balanced life. Embrace the transformative power of intuition and learn to trust your inner guidance.\n\nTranscript:\n\nDr. Karen Curry Parker:\n\nHow does a sensitive person become empathetic or empathic and not get overwhelmed, struggle with boundaries, all those things that happen to really sensitive people that can cause them to actually really kind of be burned out from caring?\n\nDr. Judith Orloff:\n\nThat's the big challenge, isn't it? You have to learn how to set boundaries with people. And you have to realize that it's not your job to take on everyone else's pain. \n\n It's not your job to fix someone. If you have appendicitis, if you have major depression, if you have a loss in your family, if my job is to fix you, you're not going to have any energy left because there's so many people who are going through so many things and it's not your responsibility.\n\nHowever, you can be a healer, and you could hold space for people, and not take on their stuff by keeping an extra little foot of distance from them, and not become enmeshed. To take a breath and just say, this person is a separate being from me.",

    "channel_id": "UCzBYOHyEEzlkRdDOSobbpvw",
    "description": "The vagus nerve is the tenth cranial nerve and a critical part of our parasympathetic nervous system. It is the longest nerve in our body and runs down the right side of our neck and supplies our organs and brain with vital information. It controls things like our heart rate, digestive tract, lung function, our ability to swallow, and even bladder control, just to name a few. But it doesn't stop there, the vagus nerve also affects our mental health, and stimulating it has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and even PTSD symptoms. They have found that when stimulated, we can more easily overcome these pesky mental illness based symptoms, so even if we feel bad, it's short lived and we can more quickly rebound.  #MentalHealthAction \n\n6 Quick Ways to Self Soothe Anxiety - https://youtu.be/Hozp3Fiqe9M\n\n#shorts video: https://youtu.be/masp6Vx5-0E\n\nI'm Kati Morton, a licensed therapist making Mental Health videos!\n#katimorton #therapist #therapy\n\n***ORDERING KATI'S BOOKS***\nAvailable in print, ebook & audiobook\n\nTRAUMATIZED  https://geni.us/Bfak0j Order Yours Today!\n\nAre u ok?  http://bit.ly/2s0mULy\n\nJOURNALING CLUB\nEvery Tuesday & Friday I post a journal prompt to help keep you motivated and working on yourself.

November 3rd-5th, 2022\n\nAs Entrepreneurs, we sacrifice health for wealth or overlook trauma for the sake of “pushing forward.” High achievers are just as (if not more) susceptible to deteriorating mental and physical health. Genius Network® is about building Better Entrepreneurs and ultimately, Better Humans. Dr. Gabor Maté’s clinical experience has come to recognize the prevailing understanding of “normal” as false, neglecting the roles that trauma and stress, and the pressures of modern-day living, exert on our bodies and our minds. Maté will help you untangle the web of a toxic culture and guide you through a compassionate approach to health and healing.\n\nIs addiction the biggest crisis we've ever faced?  Can we do anything about it?  In a candid conversation about addiction, Gabor Maté and Joe Polish define what addiction is and why it's actually a solution to the pain.\n\nGabor Maté is a Hungarian-born Canadian physician with a background in family practice and a special interest in childhood development and trauma and in their potential lifelong impacts on physical and mental health, including on ADHD, addictions, and a wide range of other conditions.\n\nRecorded live at the Genius Network Annual Event\n\n==============================================\n\nIf you’d like to join world-renowned Entrepreneurs at the next Genius Network® Event – then apply today for your invitation to attend at https://geniusnetwork.com/.\n\nReady for more Genius Network training and inspiration? \n\n🚩SUBSCRIBE 🚩 to the Youtube Channel here: https://goo.gl/0mX9id\n\nWant Joe's Free Book? https://joesfreebook.com\n\nAre you struggling with addiction?

Free training here: 🔗 https://wholebodyrevolution.com/rewire-formula\n\nIn this video I show you three vagus nerve exercises to rewire your brain from anxiety.

It warns you when a person has bad intentions (usually we call this intuition).\n\nBut we can experience anxiety in situations where we are actually safe -- and that’s when it becomes a problem. \n\nIn these cases, your nervous system has gotten “stuck” in danger mode. The whole world suddenly looks like it’s out to get you.\n\nCue the anxiety!\n\nThis is a big problem because “danger” can look like making new friends or business connections.\n\nIt can mean putting yourself out there for a promotion or going for a big new client.\n\nIt can shake your confidence -- literally, by giving you the jitters -- before your big competition.\n\nAnxiety can tell you to stay small, play it safe, keep to your lane -- when what you really want is to reach for the stars.\n\nMost anxiety treatments focus on changing your thoughts -- thinking positively, using affirmations, etc. \n\nOr, they might suggest taking a deep breath (hard to do when your diaphragm is frozen in fear -- and yes, this happens).\n\nWhat we really need are methods to jolt your nervous system out of danger mode and back into safe and happy mode (assuming you’re not actually in physical danger, of course).\n\nThis doesn’t happen at the thought level -- it happens in your biology.\n\nIn your autonomic nervous system, to be exact.\n\nYour vagus nerve is part of your autonomic nervous system and functions to help your body deal with stress.\n\nThis video gives you three vagus nerve exercises to rewire your anxious brain and bring you back to a centered state.\n\n#VagusNerveExercises #PolyvagalTheory #AnxietyRelief #SukieBaxter\n\nDISCLOSURE: This video description may include affiliate links.

    "description": "Got a pair of dumbbells? Then you can do this circuit! Build muscle, gain strength, and get ripped with Andy Speer's ultimate dumbbell circuit workout. Just don't let go until the end!\n► Total Fitness w/ Andy Speer: https://bbcom.me/3yvEAAf\n► Get The Full Workout: https://bbcom.me/3yvECbl\n► Full-Body Training Programs: https://bbcom.me/2DBghZO\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:35 - Strength & Power Complex\n01:45 - Hypertrophy Series\n03:06 - Core Series\n04:58 - Conditioning Complex\n\n\nYou don't need a gym filled with equipment to build serious muscle, strength, and conditioning. All you need is two dumbbells and a plan! I put together four complexes, each using nothing more than a pair of dumbbells and your body. Each complex will challenge you in a unique way. \n\nComplexes are great because they force you to complete a high-volume workout in a short amount of time. The key is to hang on to the weight until you've completed all the movements. No rest until you've finished a round! \n\nOnce you've completed the warm-up, grab a set of dumbbells, and get your mind and some weights ready. The first time you do the routine, just work through each complex as best as you can, and don't worry if it feels a bit awkward or the weights you have aren't ideal.\n\nIf you have more than one pair of dumbbells available, you'll probably want increase or decrease the weight depending on the complex. In general, use as much weight as you can, but don't go so heavy you can't move well. Rest 2-3 minutes between complexes, and be ready to work.\n\n| Complex 3: Core |\nYou may not see anything in the exercises listed below that screams \"core\" like, say, the hollow rock from my \"Quick Total-Body Workout,\" but trust me, you'll feel these where you should.\n\nTo make this work as a complex, perform all exercises with your right arm, rest 60 seconds, and then go through the exercises with your left arm. Keep your core tight the whole time!\n\nDuring the snatch, keep your core tight and posture solid, even when you start breathing heavily. When performing the farmer's carry, your body will naturally want to lean away from the weight, but try to lean into the weight to keep your torso nice and straight.\n\nThe get-up sit-up, or half get-up, is a great exercise for your core and far less complex than the full get-up. Keep your eyes on the dumbbell and your shoulder locked into the socket. Push through your heel on the bent-leg side. When doing plank rows, I like to elevate my nonworking arm on a dumbbell so I get a full range of motion and don't sell myself out on the bottom of the movement. Widen your legs, which will help your hips square to the floor.\n\n| Complex 4: Conditioning |\nThe final complex in this workout will test your conditioning. It may not look like much, but if you spend a little time in a split stance, you'll see why I use this as a finisher. When you're in a split stance, keep that back glute really tucked and tight and your torso vertical while you do the hammer curl. Switch legs before moving to the shoulder press.\n\nDuring the split switch, try to keep your hips as low as possible. You'll get off the ground a little bit, but you don't want to be jumping around a lot. The key is to move your feet quickly and keep your torso nice and vertical.\n\n\n| Implementing This Workout |\nPerform this workout twice per week for 2-3 weeks, resting at least two days between the workouts. If you like the results, keep going with it! Once the workouts start to feel static, add weight or reps, or decrease the reps. Do whatever you can to challenge yourself every time!\n\n========================================­=====\n\n| Follow Us |\n► Twitch: http://bit.ly/2q1dttE\n► YouTube: http://bit.ly/1RSJFa4\n► Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1lomhpr\n► Instagram: http://bit.ly/1LzBxab\n► Twitter: http://bit.ly/1RSJQlL\n► Google+: http://bit.ly/1NRe8qu\n► Pinterest: http://bit.ly/1OOZgY4\n► Spotify: http://spoti.fi/1NRebm0\n \nWe are Bodybuilding.com.

Thanks!\n\nNOTE:\nWhat if the card they picked is the mate of your key card? This isn't the worst case scenario, it's actually the best case scenario! Let's say the key card is the ten of spades. Before you go through the deck to take out a pair of cards, ask \"you didn't choose a black ten, did you?\" If they say \"no,\" carry on with the trick as usual. But if they say \"yes,\" you now know what card they chose. If it was a black ten, but it wasn't the ten of spades, they must have chosen the ten of clubs. So you can play it as if you are \"reading their mind.\" You follow up with \"that's right, I thought so -- in fact, it was the ten of clubs!\"\n\nCREDITS:\n“The Key Card,” described in Card College Volume 1 by Roberto Giobbi.\n“Quick as a Wink,” found in 72 Self Working Card Tricks by Karl Fulves.\n“The Last Laugh,” found in Scams and Fantasies with Cards by Darwin Ortiz .\nThe friction toss was first mentioned in Greater Magic in 1876.

    "description": "How Blockchain Technology,  Smart Contracts, and Tokenization will Disrupt Real Estate\n\nTechnology is always evolving and the real estate industry has always been at the forefront of technological advances. With the rise of blockchain technology, the impact on real estate will be felt by many in the future. \n\nWith blockchain technology and real estate, smart contracts will make real estate transactions quicker, more efficient, and reduce fees for all parties involved when a real estate transaction is completed. This stretches from lawyers, to realtors, to appraisers. \n\nBlockchain real estate tokenization will allow greater liquidity compared to the legacy system we currently have in place. With groups like the International Blockchain Real Estate Association, they are bringing this technology and advancements to the real estate industry on a global scale \n\nThe digitization of real estate is on our doorstep and it will be super interesting to see properties being sold off as fractional ownership allowing real estate investing to the masses and to a greater scale. \n\nThe Blockchain will radically disrupt real estate.\n\nThis is our take on how Blockchain Technology,  Smart Contracts, and Tokenization will Disrupt Real Estate.\n\n_____________________________\nRESOURCES & LINKS MENTIONED IN THIS VIDEO\n\nFor a FREE Calgary Community Map \nhttps://bit.ly/33jhoX2 \n\nFor Calgary Downtown Condo Tours \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXftS7_nxZRQeH4GMQxQ5QUQw85WgVSJA  \n\nThe Best Home Buying Tips & Info You NEED To Know\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXftS7_nxZRRuELQXfS3V9_yzntaZQCHi \n\nStart your HOME Search today\n  * Go to property type and choose your property type (Single family Home, Townhouse, Condo)\n  * Click on price ⋗ enter the min and max price\n  * Click on More ⋗ Property Details  ⋗ scroll down to see \"Area\" and choose what zone you're in\n  * (Optional) Click on more again and select more features for your dream home!\n  *  https://bit.ly/YT-SearchYourHome-2023\n____________________________\n\nFelix Chan & Jasben Lai are Calgary Realtors with the LiveInnerCity Real Estate Team in Alberta, Canada.

Free education forever ....\n1:14:20 Nano Courses eg Python, Physics, so much opportunity\n1:15:20  Fun Q - What question would you want to be asked that you haven’t been asked before?

Contrary to popular belief, crypto doesn't have to be, \"Buy and hope it goes up.\" Through DeFi, there are so many ways to earn high & safe yields on your assets, which is a total game changer in terms of portfolio construction. \n\nYield farming is not a \"get rich quick scheme,\" but rather a \"slow grind to more wealth\" strategy. And I argue that USING DeFi is the best way to LEARN DeFi, which will present natural alpha for you in the future. I am not an ecosystem maxi, but a yield maxi.

BNB is the currency used to engage in the different smart contracts.  DaPPs refer to Decentralized Applications. The most popular extension to interact with these dapps is MetaMask.\n High Risk ROI dapps are smart contracts that use a \"first in, first to get paid\" system. \nYield Farming / Staking are smart contracts that use your crypto currency as liquidity for the market. In exchange, you are paid a portion of the transaction fees. Liquidity pools deal with impermanent loss while staking is simply subject to price depreciation. \nDeFi is short for Decentralized Finance and entails everything written above as well as many other topics.

Contrary to popular belief, crypto doesn't have to be, \"Buy and hope it goes up.\" Through DeFi, there are so many ways to earn high & safe yields on your assets, which is a total game changer in terms of portfolio construction. \n\nYield farming is not a \"get rich quick scheme,\" but rather a \"slow grind to more wealth\" strategy. And I argue that USING DeFi is the best way to LEARN DeFi, which will present natural alpha for you in the future. I am not an ecosystem maxi, but a yield maxi.

    "description": "🔥 Get FREE ACCESS to Real Vision https://rvtv.io/3Y4t5Pw. Raoul Pal returns in his role as the founder of Global Macro Investor to update Real Vision members on the exponentially large role crypto is playing within his macro framework. \n\nRaoul argues that crypto is a \"black hole\" that is sucking in all of the world's talent and value at a speed that no one can comprehend and that its capacity to generate phenomenal returns for investors is not temporary but rather part of a durable long-term trend that is at the vanguard of what he calls \"The Exponential Age.\" \n\nRaoul contends that since central banks have suppressed the volatility of currencies and interest rates, large \"macro\" on heavy swings in these variables no longer offer the opportunity they once did and that it is in the world of crypto where these outsized returns can be found. Filmed on April 10, 2021. Key learnings: Raoul sees the migration of value to the digital world as an exponential trend that offers opportunities for investment returns that are no longer possible in traditional capital markets.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - The Journey of Understanding\n01:09 - Differentiating GMI and Real Vision\n02:09 - The Big Picture: Where Everything Is Going\n03:19 - The Evolution of Central Banks and Debt\n05:00 - The Rise of Bitcoin: A New Financial System\n07:19 - Bitcoin’s Early Days and Personal Investment Journey\n10:09 - The 2020 Market Collapse and Bitcoin’s Breakout\n13:00 - The Role of Central Banks and the Global Economy\n16:20 - Bitcoin as Pristine Collateral\n18:09 - The Advent of Ethereum and Metcalfe’s Law\n22:16 - The Emergence of DeFi and New Financial Systems\n27:23 - NFTs and the Internet of Value\n31:23 - The Future of Digital Realms and the Metaverse\n36:47 - Community Tokens and the New Digital Economy\n42:16 - The Exponential Age and Upcoming Technological Revolutions\n47:23 - The Global Impact of Crypto and Digital Transformation\n54:12 - Footnotes: Key Clarifications and Additional Thoughts\n\nThanks for watching Real Vision Finance!\n\nAbout Real Vision™:\nReal Vision™ is where you can gain an understanding of the complex world of finance, business, and the global economy with real in-depth analysis from real experts. \n \n\n#RaoulPal #Crypto #cryptocurrency \n\nConnect with Real Vision™ Online:\nRV Crypto: http://rvtv.io/RealVisionCrypto\nTwitter: https://rvtv.io/twitter\nInstagram: https://rvtv.io/instagram\nFacebook: https://rvtv.io/facebook\nLinkedin: https://rvtv.io/linkedin​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n#Macro #finance #macroeconomy #markets #financialmarkets #bonds #stocks #oil #gas #commodities #equities #gold\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis is pretty obvious, but we should probably say it anyway so there is no confusion…The material in REAL VISION GROUP video programs and publications {collectively referred to as “RV RELEASES”} is provided for informational purposes only and is NOT investment advice.

Contrary to popular belief, crypto doesn't have to be, \"Buy and hope it goes up.\" Through DeFi, there are so many ways to earn high & safe yields on your assets, which is a total game changer in terms of portfolio construction. \n\nYield farming is not a \"get rich quick scheme,\" but rather a \"slow grind to more wealth\" strategy. And I argue that USING DeFi is the best way to LEARN DeFi, which will present natural alpha for you in the future. I am not an ecosystem maxi, but a yield maxi. If an ecosystem presents a good risk-adjusted yield, I will be there.

Her clear intention that Jesus could heal her caused an energy transfer that Jesus not only felt, but declared an action of great faith. If your life feels constantly depleted of energy, or you want to better funnel a surplus of energy in a positive direction, this talk will empower and transform you.\n\nDon’t miss out on how you can achieve self-mastery and walk in God’s purpose for your life, with this powerful conclusion to an incredible series!\n\nSELF MASTERY SERIES:\nWEEK 1 - OWNERSHIP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubNs3G2ilqM\nWEEK 2 - MINDSET: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX12nV8jd0o",

It was incorporated on March 26, 1915. The municipality is located on natural and man-made barrier islands between the Atlantic Ocean and Biscayne Bay, the latter of which separates the Beach from the mainland city of Miami. The neighborhood of South Beach, comprising the southernmost 2.5 square miles (6.5 km2) of Miami Beach, along with downtown Miami and the Port of Miami, collectively form the commercial center of South Florida. Miami Beach's estimated population is 88,885 according to the most recent United States census estimates. Miami Beach is the 26th largest city in Florida based on official 2019 estimates from the US Census Bureau. It has been one of America's pre-eminent beach resorts since the early 20th century.\n\nIn 1979, Miami Beach's Art Deco Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Art Deco District is the largest collection of Art Deco architecture in the world and comprises hundreds of hotels, apartments and other structures erected between 1923 and 1943. Mediterranean, Streamline Moderne and Art Deco are all represented in the District. The Historic District is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the East, Lenox Court on the West, 6th Street on the South and Dade Boulevard along the Collins Canal to the North. The movement to preserve the Art Deco District's architectural heritage was led by former interior designer Barbara Baer Capitman, who now has a street in the District named in her honor.\n\n\nI hope you will enjoy the footage.

If those early investors had held on to their entire stakes, and those stakes had never been diluted by later investors, they would be $3.5 billion today — a return of 70,000x! \n\n***What is an Angel Investor?***\nAn individual who provides capital to an early stage company, usually the first outside investment to support the entrepreneur grow their business. This investment decision can be fueled by one of three main ways: 1) to support the entrepreneur, 2) solve the problem the business is solving, 3) make a financial return. Ideally all three of these come into play when making an angel investment.\n\n#EquityCrowdfunding #Investing #AngelInvesting\n\nSubscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/faresksebati/\n\n🎥 RELATED VIDEOS 🎬\n💸 How To Invest In Startups: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LylWjW9OTtw&t\n💰  How I Raised $600,000 Online: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67HfCFSOa4U\n🚀 How I Started A Global Company at 23: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqAxcZwvcUw\n\n🗳️🤵 PROFESSIONAL BIO 🚀🗳️\nFares Ksebati is the CEO of MySwimPro, a global technology and media company that creates fitness apps that help people improve their performance and health.

Her work has been presented at over 80 international conferences leading to press releases involving TV and radio networks worldwide (CNN, CBS, NBC, the Today Show, the Doctors show, etc.) and major print media.\n\nShe is the author of the instant New York Times bestseller THE XX BRAIN: the Groundbreaking Science Empowering Women to Maximize Cognitive Health and Prevent Alzheimer’s Disease and of BRAIN FOOD: The Surprising Science of Eating for Cognitive Power.\n\nIt was a pleasure to have her on the show and learn how we can all start mitigating the risk of Alzheimer’s and keep our brains healthy and active as we age! She has so much valuable wisdom to share, and it’s all backed by science!\n\nJoin me on Episode 1,091 to learn how to optimize your brain health and prevent Alzheimer’s with Dr. Lisa Mosconi!\nYou can follow me at:\nWebsite: http://lewishowes.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lewishowes/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LewisHowes\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lewishowes/\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@lewis\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewishowes/",

    "description": "copyright 2021 by Travis Ulbrich Aka YappyBeeman (tm) All Rights Reserved\n\nAnother awesome day in North Alabama today friends.    After  really rough day yesterday,  with tornadoes running all through the state, we are out catching a huge honeybee swarm from a cedar tree.   \n  I can't believe  it myself that this is the second swarm I've caught so far and both queens were captured before I ever shook the branch.  This is really making swarm catching fun.  \n   I hope you all are enjoying my 2021 Bee season kickoff with these swarm shakes.  I sure am.   I believe  it puts me ahead of my buddy's  Jpthebeeman, 628DirtRooster and Jeff Horchoff.   Although I know they will catch up quick, it's nice to lead the race at some point.   \n    Enjoy everyone and I hope you enjoyed a little fun from Yappybeeman.\n\n I get calls like this all the time, something flying in a small hole and it looks like bees or yellow jacket wasps. sometimes even for a squirrel or a raccoon. I enjoy every new experience when it comes to removing bees from structures. Construction obstacles always seem to challenge me with every job. As a bee remover, I find the good and bad in construction design. Some things look great but make it easy for bees to set up shop and call it home also. Other times, bees move in due to a lack of home maintainace. But no matter the reason, Yappy Beeman is ready to come rescue the honey bees. \n\n Check out my friends video channels also. Jpthebeeman , 628Dirtroosterbees and Jeff Horchoff for some more great honey bee videos.\n\nYappy Beeman is a professional bee remover  performing  live honey bee removals in Alabama as \"Alabama Bee Rescue\" and relocates them to apiaries away from residential areas so they can rebuild and thrive as a honey bee colony producing honey. Yappy is an Alabama Beekeepers association member that has performed over 500 live bee removals. Yappy with the help of his great friend and mentor; JpTheBeeman, a professional beekeeper , has learned many skills to remove bee swarms and honey bee colonies safely for the bees and homeowners alike.",

Join us in sharing your story and be part of the #IAmTheChange movement: http://bit.ly/ShareMenopauseStory\n\nWe're standing with women from all walks of life and breaking the silence because with knowledge comes power. Every woman goes through her own unique menopause experience. By sharing your stories, we can break the stigma and eliminate the feelings of isolation. Together, we gain control over our menopause journey.\n\nMenopause is not a series of symptoms but a transition that all women will go through, some more intense than others. Telling stories that help women know that they are not alone in their journey can be empowering! Women all over the world are taking control of their narrative and seeing that it is possible to be optimistic and powerful during and post-menopause. @Mygennev is here to change the narrative.",

    "description": "Every month, we have a theme for the content we release inside ClickingUp (and, in part, on YouTube). \n\nThis month -- based on some requests from ClickingUp members -- we're going to be talking about personal productivity in ClickUp.  Or -- to put it in less jargon-y terms -- \"What's the next best thing I should #focus on?\"\n\nTo kick things off on the virtual whiteboard this month, I'm going to be going live to break down my 2020 workflow for determining my focus. Like we do with every workflow, I'll then identify the gaps and problems in this workflow before I explain the modified workflow I'm trying in 2021.\n\nWhile this isn't the type of business processes we typically think of when we're talking about \"systemizing your business\" it's probably one of the most important #workflows for any individual -- whether you're an entrepreneur or employee!\n\nFinally, we'll wrap up with a brief discussion of what I'd need to do to translate this workflow into a #ClickUp template/structure...but we'll save the deep-dive on that conversation for a later conversation inside ClickingUp Community (processdriven.co/#services) when we release our next monthly template.\n\n(This video isn't specifically focused on personal USE (aka organizing your personal life) -- more so personal FOCUS -- but if you'd like to see more videos on that side of things just let me know!)\n\nHere's what we talked about:\n00:00 I'm a hot mess.\n2:00 Order of Operations\n3:00 What is productivity, really?\n5:31 Productivity Workflows in ClickUp\n6:51 Method #1\n13:41 Method #2\n30:31 Method #3\n53:37 How anyone could start doing this\n1:04:00 How Admins can start applying this via ClickUp Templates",

    "description": "The ClickUp Hierarchy (deciding if your project should be a Space, Folder, List, or Task in ClickUp) is hard enough...but did you know the \"right choice\" will depend heavily on your BUSINESS MODEL, not just your team size?\n\nThat's right.\n\nOrganizing #ClickUp for ecommerce requires a different setup than how you'd maintain your online #membership on ClickUp. And if you also do custom consulting? Well...it gets complex.\n\nIf you're a business with multiple income streams sporting multiple products and services, it's important to remember that you'll need to craft context for EACH of these business structures within your ClickUp Workspace.\n\nIn this ClickUp #training, I'll go through some of the most common business models and an example way we'd structure that business model inside ClickUp. \n\n(These examples are just EXAMPLES -- I am NOT suggesting there is one \"right way\" based on industry alone. There are MANY variables that go into making this decision which we spell out in our Decision Tree inside ClickingUp for members.)\n\nIn this video, we cover:\n00:00 - Introduction\n03:08 - What do you do?\n07:14 - What is ClickUp Hierarchy?\n11:33 - Where does your business fall in the ClickUp Hierarchy? (Incorporating your business model, process, team size, and aesthetic preference into your decision)\n14:46 - LIVE Questions: \"Are the emojis in your list a setting like colors, or are they in your last names and did you deactivate colors?\"\n15:54 - 3 Options to help you choose which hierarchy is right for your business.\n16:36 - Option #1: Trial and Error\n20:01 - Option #2: Layla's Shortcut\n29:07 - LIVE Question: \"Can I sync between two accounts? (Personal and work accounts.)\n30:40 - Option #3: DIY with a Process Org Chart\n33:19 - LIVE Question: \"Is it better to align your business functions with biz-ops, hr., finance, IT, to a space first?\"\n34:26 - Examples of each option to help you choose your ClickUp Hierarchy.\n44:52 - LIVE Question: \"What's the advantage of placing all recurring tasks, for all clients, in one list rather than separating by folders for each client?\"\n47:15 - LIVE Question: \"What's your recommendation for project-based clients?\"\n49:00 - LIVE Question: \"How do you feel about building ClickUp out as if the employee already exists, separating tasks by job before separate people actually have that job?\"\n1:01:36 - LIVE Question: \"Do you recommend attaching files in ClickUp or a file storage like GDrive?\"\n1:02:00 - Key Takeaways\n\nRelated Videos: \n➡️ Clean vs. Modern Sidebar Layout | ClickUp Collaboration Troubleshooting https://youtu.be/E36S6NZXQz0\n➡️ Quick ClickUp Tour for Beginners | Is ClickUp right for you? https://youtu.be/m5NRpc1e-UU\n➡️ What are ClickApps? | ClickUp tutorial to enable automations, Clip, time tracking, & other features https://youtu.be/O6cupfMsrlU\n➡️ ClickUp Folder vs. List vs. Task | Organize in the ClickUp Hierarchy https://youtu.be/e9Y-8F6i4io\n➡️ ClickUp Views EXPLAINED | ClickUp tutorial for beginners on Filters, Group by, Sort by, & Me Mode https://youtu.be/O8NPrqbXYyE\n➡️ \"Adulting\" with ClickUp | How to Organize Your Life in ClickUp (Tour) https://youtu.be/EHPuUJh10Sc\n➡️ 3 ClickUp Recurring Tasks FAQs, Answered https://youtu.be/hsum33jQDes\n➡️ Build a ClickUp CRM | Relationships & Rollups Use Case Tutorial https://youtu.be/6ttdHMACqKM\n\n/ / / / / /      SUPPORT OUR WORK     / / / / / /  \n\n🔥 Want to work with me to get your ClickUp in order?

    "description": "At Wickenburg Ranch in Wickenburg Arizona, they have a hidden gem golf course called Little Wick. It is the coolest Par 3 Golf Course in the World. \n\nCourse Info:  http://www.wickenburgranch.com/lil-wick-9-hole/\nFollow on Instagram for Daily Content: @sharpergolf_\nFollow me on Facebook: SharperGolf\n\nThe Par 3 golf course is built on a large rocky hill that is a few minute golf cart drive from the clubhouse. The Little Wick has a very casual atmosphere that takes the pressure off of playing golf and encourages you to just have fun. In the center of the course is an outdoor bar and grill where you can have lunch and grab a drink, or just sit outside and relax and enjoy the sites. \n\nThe casual atmosphere is all encompassing, there is no dress code. I noticed people playing in shorts and flip flops.  I believe the local residents can play this course for free.  There were entire families of 8 - 10 people including small kids playing as a single group. This didn't seem to slow down play at all for my group.  We just took it easy and played at a moderate pace and still finished in around 1 hour and 10 minutes. \n\nThe course has speakers setup on the Tee boxes and greens and they play (at least on this day) music from the 70's and 80's which gives the golf course a really relaxed feel.  \n\nI played this Par 3 course in the afternoon after I had played the Big Wick full 18 hole course in the morning.  I didn't play particularly well on the Big Wick, so I wan't expecting to hit many greens on the Little Wick, but I surprised myself and played rather well.  I think the relaxed atmosphere and great company helped me play better.  \n\nI played with a delightful retired couple that lives in the community. They had played the Little Wick many times and shared all of their local knowledge with me.  Which really helped me when it came to club selection.  Nick has even made a Hole in One on this course before.  They were great fun to play golf with and I really appreciated them letting me film the round and how welcoming and nice they were.  \n\nI highly recommend playing Wickenburg Ranch The Big Wick and Little Wick. If you plan a trip to the Phoenix / Scottsdale area you need to add Wickenburg Ranch to your list. It a bit of a drive, but well worth it.  Of all the Top Courses I've played in Arizona, the Big Wick is my new Favorite.  \n\nThis Golf VLOG is different from my normal style of VLOG and hope you enjoy the music and descriptions of my play.  Leave me a comment below and let me know if you like it.  \n\nI hope you enjoy the video. \n\nSharpen Your Game!",

    "description": "If you get frustrated trying to sharpen a serrated blade, this hack is for you!  NO SPECIAL TOOLS REQUIRED!

    "channel": "ATHLEAN-X™",
    "channel_id": "UCe0TLA0EsQbE-MjuHXevj2A",
    "description": "If you want to see how to lose stubborn belly fat and get rid of it once and for all, then this is a video that you don’t want to miss. Here I’m going to ask you 4 tough but important questions that you will need to answer honestly. When you do however, I can promise you that you will lose your belly fat for good and never have to worry about it coming back again.\n\n60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/153-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://youtube.com/user/jdcav24\n\nLosing fat is one of the easiest and hardest things to do when it comes to getting in shape. This is because science makes it very clear what the process is. The issue however is that sticking to what science says we should do can become challenging and fat loss can stall pretty quickly. That said, the first thing we all must do is look in the mirror. No, not to look at the areas where you are storing your stubborn fat like on your belly, hips or love handles.\n\nInstead, you need to look in the mirror to face the tough assessment that is often times needed to get over the hump. You first must be willing to address the “how to lose stubborn belly fat” question. Is it really stubborn? Meaning, are you carrying just too much fat around your waist because your overall body fat levels are high or are we talking about the last few percentage points of fat levels that stick around despite your best and most consistent efforts.\n\nIf it’s the former, then increasing the consistency with which you do the right thing will quickly get you to the next level of fat loss. If however you believe you are doing everything you can but still can’t seem to get to the lean ripped level you want to be, then the additional questions will help to dig into the “why”.\n\nWe start with drinking. I understand that the desire to drink is driven far more by social benefits than it is by simply trying to quench your thirst. For this reason, it is often something that many people are unwilling to forgo. I can tell you this however. With the rapid pace that one is able to consume and pile up liquid calories along with the metabolic impact that alcohol has on your ability to burn fat, drinking is always going to make it more difficult to get ripped and lean and to lose body fat than not drinking.\n\nThat said, you have to ask yourself how important it is for you to have a six pack. If that doesn’t mean as much to you as partaking in certain social activities then you will have to find the balance that makes you most happy. This is going to be individual for everyone and nobody should place their expectations on you, me included.\n\nNext we have to discuss your nutrition. No pursuit of fat loss can occur without a frank discussion about what you are consuming every day. In order to lose fat you have to be in a calorie deficit, period. How you get there however, is very important. If you use crash diets and carbohydrate exclusion methods, you are likely never going to see the long term success you should in trying to lose fat and will be unhappy when you put back on any weight lost.\n\nIf you are in a deficit but still have to lose belly fat, then you have to assess three other areas discussed in this video. The first is the cleanliness of your diet. How healthy are you really eating? Often times, this is not as good as you may think it is. If however you insist that it is good but you have more fat to lose then you next must evaluate your portion sizes. If this is good still, then you have nothing left but to be honest about your consistency. Here is where an assessment of your cheat meal frequency comes in.\n\nFrom here, your training must be evaluated. You must train. Diet alone is never going to be enough when it comes to losing belly fat forever. A training plan that consists of more than just cardio is necessary if you want to build lean muscle tissue capable of helping to increase your metabolism and get you burning more calories more easily. Here is where 3-5 time per week weight training with an inclusion of barbell complexes is ideal.\n\nFinally, ab training is something you will want to do as well. Not because there are any spot reduction benefits of this but because when these muscles are developed you get a visual impact that often helps to motivate you to keep doing more of the other things mentioned earlier.\n\nIf you are looking for a step by step workout and meal plan that will get rid of belly fat, get you more ripped than ever and help you to build athletic muscle, be sure to visit athleanx.com at the link below and check out any one of the ATHLEAN-X programs that best matches your current goals.\n\nIf you are looking for more videos on how to burn fat as well as ab workout videos to lose belly fat, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on youtube via the link below and remember to turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it’s published.",

    "description": "Paint polishing tutorial for beginners!!  In this video, you’ll learn everything there is to know about paint polishing including which products to use, what tools you need and how to perform the steps for a compound and a polish.  This way, you’ll be able to remove any scratches and swirl marks and make your paint glossy again!\n\n►►SUBSCRIBE and LIKE today’s video & Turn On Notifications for New Videos - http://bit.ly/PanTheOrganizer\n\nPaint polishing is usually split in two steps: compound and polish.  Paint polishing is a car detailing technique used to remove defects in the paint through paint correction.  By removing a thin layer of clear coat, you’ll remove scratches, swirls marks, marring and oxidation, get better clarity from your paint, make the color of the paint “pop” and make it more glossy and shiny.  By levelling the clear coat through paint polishing, you’re allowing light to bounce off better thus increasing the gloss levels.\n\n🔥 For more quality detailing products visit: https://tinyurl.com/bdehsjys\n\n⬇️🔶 LINKS TO PRODUCTS MENTIONED IN THIS VIDEO ⬇️⬇️\n\n🇺🇸 For people in USA:\nMeguiar’s DA Microfiber Cutting Disc: https://bit.ly/34dP9uB\nMeguiar’s DA Microfiber Correction Compound: https://amzn.to/2Lh5z9u\nMeguiar’s DA Microfiber Finishing Disc: https://bit.ly/3jfivNE\nMeguiar’s DA Microfiber Finishing Wax (polish): https://amzn.to/47pI2gs\nMeguiar’s Ultimate Compound: https://amzn.to/2LmoW0Q\nMeguiar’s Ultimate Polish: https://amzn.to/2Hk67Jh\nJescar Correcting Compound: https://amzn.to/476p6Up\nSonax Perfect Finish polish: https://bit.ly/3o6SVOi\nMenzerna SF3500 polish: https://amzn.to/3sqzvv1\n3D HD Speed All-in-One (AIO): https://amzn.to/2suCn7N\nGriot’s Garage BOSS Finishing Sealant (AIO): https://amzn.to/2xLdr0K\nGriot’s Garage BOSS Perfecting Foam Pads: https://amzn.to/2LjoJeV\nLake Country CCS Foam pads: https://bit.ly/35ej4SP\nGyeon Prep: https://amzn.to/2LUg2Zq\nCarPro Eraser: https://bit.ly/31mANqb\n \nPolishers for beginners:\nMaxshine M15: https://amzn.to/3WFX3Fr\nGriot's Garage DA polisher: https://amzn.to/3FKVNdu\n\nPolishers for enthusiasts and pros:\nFlex 3401 DA polisher: https://amzn.to/474IVeP\nRupes LHR15 MKIII DA polisher: https://bit.ly/2HhhNlN\n\nTools and equipment:\nRupes swirl finder LED light: https://bit.ly/3FRZZIO\nPad conditioning brush: https://amzn.to/2J8Kphb\nPolishing pad conditioner: https://amzn.to/3MC4Z8h\nPolishing pad cleaner: https://amzn.to/3svrrZU\nThe Rag Company microfiber towels: https://amzn.to/2Ljap5R\n\n🇨🇦 For people in Canada:\nMeguiar’s DA Microfiber Cutting Disc: https://bit.ly/31oTysP\nMeguiar’s DA Microfiber Correction Compound: https://bit.ly/34aTcbe\nMeguiar’s DA Microfiber Finishing Disc: https://bit.ly/3o96Sv5g\nMeguiar’s DA Microfiber Polish: https://bit.ly/3o8kpDm\nMeguiar’s Ultimate Compound: https://amzn.to/2Lh65UE\nMeguiar’s UItimate Polish: https://amzn.to/2JuzLR0\nSonax Perfect Finish polish: https://bit.ly/359BpAs\nMenzerna SF3500 polish: https://bit.ly/3o6yKQH\nGriot’s Garage BOSS Finishing Sealant (AIO): https://bit.ly/3kf6mtk\nGriot’s Garage BOSS Perfecting Foam Pads: https://amzn.to/2J8Xk2z\nLake Country CCS Foam pads: https://bit.ly/3kfeDxh\nGyeon Prep: https://bit.ly/3kj2FTq\nCarPro Eraser: https://bit.ly/3o9h1YY\nGriot’s Garage DA polisher: https://bit.ly/31r37rs\nFlex 3401 DA polisher: https://bit.ly/3khOyOb\nRupes LHR15 MKIII DA polisher: https://bit.ly/34c26VH\nRupes swirl finder LED penlight: https://bit.ly/2HoDnob\nPad conditioning brush: https://amzn.to/2kKd4u9\nPolishing pad conditioner: https://amzn.to/2JoU5U1\nPolishing pad cleaner: https://amzn.to/2Jcu9fa\nThe Rag Company microfiber towels: https://amzn.to/2kIkcaq\n\n🇬🇧 For people in the UK:\nMeguiar’s Ultimate Compound: https://amzn.to/2kNHhbF\nMeguiar’s Ultimate Polish: https://amzn.to/3u8K72b\nMeguiar’s DA Microfiber pads, compounds and polishes: https://amzn.to/2xFOiVf\nSonax Perfect Finish Polish: https://amzn.to/2su2a03\nMenzerna SF3500 Polish: https://amzn.to/2HhUpi4\nMenzerna Heavy Cut Compound: https://amzn.to/2sDrCiW\nDual action polisher: https://amzn.to/3QTeJgM\nLake Country CCS Foam pads: https://bit.ly/47v5UPF\nPad conditioning brush: https://amzn.to/49zmMHc\nGyeon Prep: https://amzn.to/2LXw98G\nCarPro Eraser: https://bit.ly/3q6ljlU\nThe Rag Company microfiber towels: https://amzn.to/3QtbpHU\n\nDISCLAIMER: This video and description contain affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the product links, I’ll receive a small commission on a purchase without additional cost to you.

    "description": "Welcome to this sleep hypnosis to fall asleep fast and release your day for a relaxing, deep sleep. \n\nThis deep sleep hypnosis experience is a form of guided sleep meditation, with spoken suggestions for complete relaxation, accompanied with a soothing soundscape of gentle background sleeping music and calming ocean waves.\n\nThis bedtime hypnotic session combines aspects of self hypnosis, guided meditation, mind and body relaxation, and guided visualization to allow you a serene sense of floating and drifting into blissfully tranquil, positive dreams.\n\nListen along and allow yourself to relax deeply, as you learn how to let go of physical tensions in the body, as well as melt away unwanted stresses or worries in the mind. Reduce the effects of overthinking, as you turn down any excessive noise of the mind's chatter, by more easily resting into deep peace at every bedtime. \n\nI hope you relax and enjoy this positive journey towards your deep sleep rest :)\n\nDownload this digital MP3 track: ► https://michael-sealey.dpdcart.com/cart/add?product_id=196297&method_id=213600\n\nSubscribe for more meditation & hypnosis: ► http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=MichaelSealey\n\nDownloads on iTunes: ► https://itunes.apple.com/au/artist/michael-sealey/id921827456\n\nDepression & Anxiety Recovery Pack 5 x MP3 Digital Audio Collection here:  ► https://michael-sealey.dpdcart.com/cart/add?product_id=121819&method_id=129715\n\nSleep Meditation 4 x MP3 Digital Audio Collection here: ► https://michael-sealey.dpdcart.com/cart/add?product_id=155119&method_id=165916\n\nThis session is suitable for repeated listening.

    "description": "Every year our church—Bethany Presbyterian Church in Seattle Washington— ends our Easter services with an invitation to come forward and join the choir in singing Handel's Hallelujah Chorus. People stream forward and pack onto the chancel. I count it off and away we go. Every year—in all of it's rough-around-the-edges beauty—this impromptu performance is one of the most hopeful, fun events of my year. The first time I had the pleasure of directing this mass of people I nearly cried through the whole thing. \n\nAs churches are shuttered due to COVID-19, I wanted to find a way for this tradition to live on. A number of choir members had sent me the virtual choir videos that have been circulating online and I realized we could do this for the Hallelujah Chorus. I offered an invitation to the choir and other singers I know, much like I do in worship every Easter. This time it was via email. What you have here is our 2020 Hallelujah chorus ritual. I hope seeing all these faces together reminds you that someday, our hallelujahs will will echo together in person.\n\nI am grateful to all the people who made this wild idea possible and for all the singers who were brave enough to send me videos of just their face and voice singing their part of the Hallelujah Chorus. Thanks you, and great job!",

    "description": "If you are stuck at home and in need of some new creative home exercise options, this video is for you. Here I show you 29 home exercise hacks that you can use in any home workout to train your entire body without missing a beat. Just because you can’t get to a gym to get your workouts in doesn’t mean that you can’t effectively train your body.\n\n60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/139-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://youtube.com/user/jdcav24\n\nAll you have to do is open your eyes to the possibilities in your immediate surrounding. Many people think that they don’t have enough room or money to afford a good home gym. That’s not true. You can do so many exercises that you may never have realized you could just by using some handy pieces of equipment around your house.\n\nThe first is your staircase. In the gym, either a bench or a plyometric box is used to perform lower body step up variations, box jumps and even lunge combinations. The stairway in your own house or apartment complex can be just as useful. You even have the option of stepping up one or two stairs at a time to decrease or increase the difficulty as needed. The upper body can be worked too, such as using it to perform decline pushups for your upper chest.\n\nThe kitchen is also an amazing place to find new exercise opportunities. For instance, if you have a corner to your kitchen counter you can do all sorts of dips (for the chest or triceps) as well as hanging ab exercises. Instead of having to hang on a bar at the gym to perform hanging leg raises or knee raises for example, you can simply support your body in the corner and do the exact same movements without having to sacrifice the benefits.\n\nEver thought about using your hardwood or tile floors to your advantage in your workouts? This is one of the best ways to get your posterior chain muscles fired up. Take off your shoes and leave your socks on. Perform exercises like the hamstring bridge and curl to make your glutes and hams work in concert as intended. Turn over and perform upper body pulldowns for your lats, an area that is often hard to work when you don’t have the normal equipment options from the gym.\n\nDon’t underestimate the value of your doorway either. As long as you have a solid door jamb, you can use it to perform either pullups or chinups. The extra benefit of the climbers grip makes it even more demanding than a normal pullup on your forearm and gripping muscles. The door jamb itself can be used to work your shoulders too. Both the deltoids and the rotator cuff can be trained by either an isometric lateral raise or the home face pull variation just covered in a recent video.\n\nIf you are looking for replacements for the dumbbells or weights that you would use at a gym there are actually plenty. One of my favorites is a poland spring water jug. When full, these weigh in at 40 pounds. This can be used for biceps curl variations, one arm shoulder cleans and even shoulder pressing over and back. The extra benefit of the sloshing of the water is that it demands more muscle stability and control throughout the explosive movements making them even more challenging.\n\nBroomsticks, tupperware lids and even your own computer are other helpful things laying around your house that can be turned into exercise machines by the time this video is over. Don’t be afraid to explore all of them. If you are looking for a complete home workout program that you can do without any equipment at all, and have a step by step meal plan included as well, be sure to check out the ATHLEAN XERO program at athleanx.com at the link below.\n\nFor more home workout videos and home exercises that you can do anywhere, be sure to subscribe to our youtube at the link below and don’t forget to turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it’s published.",

See your joy as available to you just on the other side of a door, you simply need to open it and let joy into your heart.  Today, bring joy intentionally into your world and heart.

NEW UPDATE: Get my NEW 🏆 Affiliate Marketing Crash Course 🏆 for FREE, here: https://www.milesbeckler.com/free-affiliate-course \n\nI've broken down everything I did in order to build, launch and grow a brand new affiliate site to over $3500/mo in profit in simple step-by-step format... It's 100% beginner friendly and of course, it's yours 100% free...  Because my lifestyle is supported by my affiliate sites NOT from selling you courses... 👍\n\nIf you are new to the world of affiliate marketing and you are wondering how to earn income as an affiliate, be sure to watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tD97-K5TeE\n\nFor help with the actual structure (and creation) of an affiliate marketing funnel is simple... This video shows that marketing funnel in detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV-lq5Popvo\n\nTo build out a funnel like that is also quite simple...\n\nHow to build a funnel video series is here and the affiliate marketing funnel is covered in video 1: https://m.youtube.com/watch?list=PL0sOKzn__yK3iOONk6-QP0Se2G23ZcuWL&v=YsUNFZhqkEA\n\nThe theory behind running paid Facebook advertising is also quite simple!\n\nThe how to advertise on Facebook videos are here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?list=PL0sOKzn__yK2WLfPcyzwnULUV3uy8031s&v=XYY6zn3c8Xk\n\nSo if the funnel and the traffic side are both simple, why is affiliate marketing with Facebook ads so difficult?\n\nThe real answer is because most people are not patient enough to invest the time and energy needed to build a true relationship with a visitor...\n\nThis is the key to making money with affiliate marketing as explained in great detail in this post here: https://www.milesbeckler.com/make-money-with-affiliate-marketing/\n\nThey are trying to bypass the process of growing an email list and developing a relationship with the subscriber and they are going for the sale way too soon...\n\nOften direct linking people from the facebook ad to the affiliate program which is a recipe for disaster in the affiliate marketing world.\n\nHonoring the relationship you create with every single subscriber is so key to success with Facebook ads and affiliate marketing.\n\nYou may think that linking someone from a Facebook advertisement to your affiliate link for a Clickbank product is a 'short cut' bit you are setting yourself up for failure.\n\nI know... Because I made this costly affiliate marketing rookie mistake years ago.\n\nI'm trying to help you learn from my mistakes and show you the right way to do affiliate marketing with Facebook!\n\nAlthough this video may seem simple, the true secret to success with affiliate marketing is in this video.\n\nWhether you are using facebook advertising, content marketing or organic facebook traffic to fill your affiliate marketing funnel with traffic, leads and prospects... The game is the same.\n\nYou must bring value to the marketplace and help your personal brand stand out so you become a trusted advisor to the people you are connecting with through your advertising.\n\nThe mechanism to truly develop this relationship is your email list which is why focusing on growing your email list and being of value to your email list is vitally important to your success as an affiliate marketer.\n\nIf you want help with \"how to do email marketing as an affiliate\" be sure to check out the email marketing video I did with my wife where she reveals a powerful autoresponder series that you can use to get going!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWAXJD-dP4Y\n\nFor the Facebook ads case study and to receive my emails, go here: http://www.milesbeckler.com/fbads",

    "description": "http://www.enrollmarketing.com/blueprint-pro/\n\nWhat Exactly Is A Dark Post On Facebook And Why is The Best WAy TO Advertise\n\nWith the holiday buying season about to kick into full swing, it's vital that you use every piece of arsenal you have to stay ahead of your competitors. This includes monitoring updates for search engine algorithms and metrics as well as new features on social media networks. If you've been doing your homework, you'll already know about two great new Ad Features on Facebook, if you haven't been, we're here for you with the cheat sheet.\n\nUsing Campaign Labels on Facebook Ads\n\nFirst up is the new way to give your campaigns some more structure. Facebook recently rolled out the Campaign Label options, which is exclusive to the PE (Power Editor) so if you aren't using it already, you should start now. This is a great tool for internet marketing campaigns where you have more than one running at a time and with more than one initiative. This will help you keep all of your campaigns in order for easy reference in the future.\n\nSimply head to your PE dashboard (in Facebook Ads Manager on the left), download your ad account and pick the \"Campaign View\" selection. Your campaign labels will be grouped together on the left-hand column in PE where you normally see \"Recent, Active, Paused and All\" categories. With the Campaign Label function, you can easily pull up successful campaigns and use the meta data to shape your new ones or access your new advertising campaigns to quickly cross-reference them.\n\nThis can be super-handy around the holiday season as you can get a better handle on your Cyber Monday ad campaigns, Black Friday ad campaigns, Christmas ad campaigns, etc. Clear up the clutter on you Facebook Ads wall today and better analyze your data for more successful Facebook Ads moving forward.\n\nFinding Your Unpublished or Dark Page Posts on Facebook\n\nIf you don't want to publish an ad just yet to your Newsfeed, simply create them, amplify them, change, them, whatever, by keeping them dark. Officially called \"Unpublished Posts\", your dark page is also exclusive to your PE. This one takes a little while to show up so if you're new to Facebook Ads, you might need to get some more experience to access the feature (not sure why Facebook did this, but look for it to change in the near future as the Ad Features become more ingrained in everyday advertising use).\n\nTo create an Unpublished Ad, simply create the Ad, choose the Page Post as the ad type and select \"Create New Unpublished Post.\" By doing this, you'll be able to do some great A/B testing with your posts, further increasing the functionality and overall usefulness of Facebook Ads. While they were once simple in nature, their complexity is making for a more streamlined targeted ad campaign, making Facebook a viable contender for the best internet marketing tool.\n\nYou can also use dark posts to geo-target your audience with specific promotions. Switch between locations, genders, age groups, etc. This helps you get a better handle on and understanding of your audience. And if you love boosting your posts, keeping them unpublished at certain times will keep your Facebook page unclouded with spammy feeling ads. This directly increases the effectiveness of your boosted post since while they are unpublished, they aren't spamming up your customer's newsfeeds and also aren't running out your paid reach budget (think of it like a pause button).\n\nKeeping Up with the Latest Social Media Tools\n\nThe bottom line here isn't so much the tools or how to use them-you've probably dealt with similar marketing tools on other platforms. The real thing to take away here is that you should be exploring the social media tool update posts, especially around the holidays when new products and features are rolling out every day.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wWlGiHhD9rs",

    "description": "A courageous talk by teacher Mark Raines on how losing his normal ability to speak helped him find his true voice.  By tackling his challenge with passion, grace and determination, this teacher's personal struggles and triumphs have provided the greatest lesson of all to his students.  \n\nAn award-winning television and film teacher at Canyon Crest Academy, Mark Raines, is passionate about helping students find and share their voice through film.  He was named National New Teacher of the Year by the Association for Career and Technical Education in 2008 and also received teaching recognition from the Toyota International Teacher Program, USAToday, and the Radio Shack National Teacher Award. For the past 14 years, Mark has been the executive producer of a weekly student-produced television broadcast along with hundreds of student films and videos, often showcased in the nation's largest film festivals.  \n\nTEDxYouth@SanDiego is an independently organized TEDx event designed by youth, for youth to bring the power of big ideas to the youth of San Diego -- and the world. www.TEDxYouthSanDiego.com\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",
