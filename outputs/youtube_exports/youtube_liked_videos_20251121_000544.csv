eblZP9Zjs4k,Lost Motivation? A late start doesn't mean you lost.,Best of Shorts,UC9Swz7jX_jqfRKwP6MmSVFw,"Sometimes the Universe has other plans for you...

This a common idiom used to express the idea that events in life don't always unfold as we expect or desire, and that there might be a larger, unseen force or destiny guiding our path.

It's often said in situations where:

- Something unexpected happens: You might have had a specific goal or plan, and then an unforeseen circumstance (good or bad) completely alters your direction.
- A setback occurs: You tried something, and it didn't work out, leading to a feeling that perhaps you were meant for something different.
- An opportunity arises: A door closes, and then another, perhaps better, one opens unexpectedly.
- Comfort or reassurance: It can be used to comfort someone who is disappointed, suggesting that their current disappointment is part of a larger, ultimately beneficial, trajectory.
- Essentially, it's a way of saying, ""Don't worry, even if things aren't going your way right now, there's a reason for it, and something else, perhaps even better, is waiting for you."" It implies a belief in fate, destiny, or a higher purpose.

🎬 Core Video Description

In this video, I demonstrate how to transform your Make.com automations into ready-to-use n8n workflow templates in seconds. Watch as I break down the inner workings of Make.com’s JSON blueprints and reveal a custom-built, drag-and-drop conversion tool that seamlessly translates them for use in n8n. I cover everything from understanding the unique JSON structures behind each platform to leveraging advanced techniques—using GPT-03 and Perplexity—for error checking and mapping modules correctly.

This guide includes:

An introduction to the fundamentals of Make.com automation and its JSON representation
A detailed walkthrough of the conversion tool: setting up file triggers, re-encoding binary data, and mapping nodes
A deep dive into crafting precise prompts to convert JSON while handling unsupported integrations
Real-world examples (like the Cleo and Social Media Content Planner workflows) and troubleshooting tips
A discussion on when to stick with Make.com versus scaling up with n8n for cost and flexibility benefits

nkhrxtrfBTc,"I AM Magnet for Wealth | Positive Morning Affirmations | Health, Happiness,  Abundance Affirmations",Bosque Neuroscience,UCMZ26xVv19iLl6BRsPg9Xpw,"Good Morning!! Today, I want to talk to you about the power of affirmations and how they can transform your life. Specifically, I want to share with you the amazing affirmation ""I am a magnet for wealth.""

Repeat after me: ""I am a magnet for wealth."" Say it out loud, say it with conviction, and feel the energy of these words flowing through your body. This simple yet powerful affirmation has the ability to attract abundance and prosperity into your life.

You see, our thoughts and words have a tremendous impact on our reality. When we constantly tell ourselves that we are not good enough, that we don't deserve wealth, or that we will never be successful, we are creating a negative energy that repels abundance. On the other hand, when we affirm positive statements like ""I am a magnet for wealth,"" we are sending out a powerful message to the universe that we are open and ready to receive all the blessings that come our way.
But it's not just about saying the words, it's aout truly believing in them. When you say ""I am a magnet for wealth,"" you are declaring to the universe that you are worthy and deserving of abundance. You are shifting your mindset from scarcity to abundance, and that is when the magic happens.

This affirmation is not just about attracting financial wealth, it's about attracting all forms of abundance into your life. Health, happiness, love, and success are all forms of abundance that can be manifested through this powerful affirmation. By declaring that you are a magnet for wealth, you are also affirming that you are a magnet for health, happiness, and abundance in all areas of your life.

So, my dear friends, I encourage you to start your day with this powerful affirmation. Say it in the morning, say it throughout the day, and say it before you go to bed. Let it become a mantra that you repeat to yourself whenever you need a reminder of your worth and potential.

Remember, you are a powerful magnet for wealth and abundance. Believe it, feel it, and watch as your life transforms in the most amazing ways. Trust in the process and have faith that the universe will bring you all that you desire.

I am sending you all love, light, and abundance. Keep affirming, keep believing, and keep manifesting. You are worthy, you are deserving, and you are a magnet for wealth. Have a beautiful day, my friends.

M_XhFelKIaI,Good Things Are Happening To Me | Daily Positive Affirmations For Success And Positive Thinking,Bosque Neuroscience,UCMZ26xVv19iLl6BRsPg9Xpw,"Hello everyone! Today, I want to share with you all some amazing news - good things are happening to me! I am overflowing with joy and gratitude as I see my life transforming in the most positive ways.

I have been practicing daily positive affirmations for success and positive thinking, and let me tell you, it has made all the difference. I used to be someone who constantly doubted myself and my abilities, but now I am filled with confidence and self-belief. I have learned to let go of negative thoughts and replace them with empowering affirmations.

And the results have been incredible. Opportunities are coming my way, doors are opening, and I am achieving my goals one by one. It's like the universe is aligning with my positive mindset and bringing me all the good things I deserve.

But it's not just about external success. My inner peace and happiness have also increased tenfold. I am more content with who I am and where I am in life. I have learned to appreciate the present moment and trust in the journey.

I want to encourage each and every one of you to start incorporating daily positive affirmations into your life. It may seem silly or insignificant at first, but trust me, it can truly change your life. Start by saying things like ""I am capable,"" ""I am worthy,"" ""I am deserving of all the good things coming my way."" Repeat them every day, and watch as your mindset shifts and attracts positivity into your life.

Remember, good things are always happening, even if we can't see them at the moment. Trust in the process and keep a positive outlook, and you will see the magic unfold in your life.

I am so grateful for all the good things happening to me, and I know that more blessings are on the way. I hope this post serves as a reminder to never give up on your dreams and to always believe in yourself. You are capable of achieving anything you set your mind to.

Sending love and positivity to all of you. Keep shining bright and never stop believing in the power of positive thinking. Good things are happening to you too, just wait and see.

Transcript:

Karen Curry Parker:

Ancient wisdom keepers created archetype-based personality systems such as astrology and numerology and the I Ching to determine who we are, how we are, and why we're here.  In modern times, we've turned to science to explain who we are. We've learned that certain personality traits are inherited. We've discovered that our DNA is more malleable than we thought, continuing to fuel the nurture versus nature debate.

We've learned that the protein coats that regulate how our genes function, epigenes, contain ancestral memories that influence how we experience the world, and particularly how we create wellness and well-being.  When you work to shift your personal story on the quantum level, mental and emotional level, the subtle body level, and the physical level, you create a dynamic, integrated matrix that helps you shift your personal story permanently.",2024-08-05T16:17:52Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mYdfIXo8PE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2mYdfIXo8PE/hqdefault.jpg,PT55S,221,18,1

Today, Dr. Judith Orloff explores the profound connection between intuition and healing. Discover how tuning into your inner voice can guide you through life's challenges and enhance your well-being. Dr. Orloff provides insights into how empaths and highly sensitive individuals can develop their intuitive abilities to create a more fulfilling and balanced life. Embrace the transformative power of intuition and learn to trust your inner guidance.

Transcript:

Dr. Karen Curry Parker:

How does a sensitive person become empathetic or empathic and not get overwhelmed, struggle with boundaries, all those things that happen to really sensitive people that can cause them to actually really kind of be burned out from caring?

Dr. Judith Orloff:

That's the big challenge, isn't it? You have to learn how to set boundaries with people. And you have to realize that it's not your job to take on everyone else's pain. 

 It's not your job to fix someone. If you have appendicitis, if you have major depression, if you have a loss in your family, if my job is to fix you, you're not going to have any energy left because there's so many people who are going through so many things and it's not your responsibility.

However, you can be a healer, and you could hold space for people, and not take on their stuff by keeping an extra little foot of distance from them, and not become enmeshed. To take a breath and just say, this person is a separate being from me.",2024-06-06T00:59:01Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwWrpaZZGVc,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PwWrpaZZGVc/hqdefault.jpg,PT1M,828,36,2

fSN2CeDkslg,5 Easy Ways to STIMULATE THE VAGUS NERVE,Kati Morton,UCzBYOHyEEzlkRdDOSobbpvw,"The vagus nerve is the tenth cranial nerve and a critical part of our parasympathetic nervous system. It is the longest nerve in our body and runs down the right side of our neck and supplies our organs and brain with vital information. It controls things like our heart rate, digestive tract, lung function, our ability to swallow, and even bladder control, just to name a few. But it doesn't stop there, the vagus nerve also affects our mental health, and stimulating it has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and even PTSD symptoms. They have found that when stimulated, we can more easily overcome these pesky mental illness based symptoms, so even if we feel bad, it's short lived and we can more quickly rebound.  #MentalHealthAction

1. Kick and bass processing
2. Percussion

See Dr. Gabor Maté Live at the 2022 Genius Network Annual Event! November 3rd-5th, 2022

As Entrepreneurs, we sacrifice health for wealth or overlook trauma for the sake of “pushing forward.” High achievers are just as (if not more) susceptible to deteriorating mental and physical health. Genius Network® is about building Better Entrepreneurs and ultimately, Better Humans. Dr. Gabor Maté’s clinical experience has come to recognize the prevailing understanding of “normal” as false, neglecting the roles that trauma and stress, and the pressures of modern-day living, exert on our bodies and our minds. Maté will help you untangle the web of a toxic culture and guide you through a compassionate approach to health and healing.

Is addiction the biggest crisis we've ever faced?  Can we do anything about it?  In a candid conversation about addiction, Gabor Maté and Joe Polish define what addiction is and why it's actually a solution to the pain.

Gabor Maté is a Hungarian-born Canadian physician with a background in family practice and a special interest in childhood development and trauma and in their potential lifelong impacts on physical and mental health, including on ADHD, addictions, and a wide range of other conditions.

-- Vagus Nerve Exercises To Rewire Your Brain From Anxiety --

If you’re someone who frequently struggles with anxiety -- or even just worried thoughts -- you might think your brain is broken.

Not true.

Anxiety is actually a survival mechanism.

It tells you when you’re in danger -- or at least when your nervous system believes it is.

Anxiety tells you to step away from a high cliff edge so you don’t fall to your death. It warns you when a person has bad intentions (usually we call this intuition).

But we can experience anxiety in situations where we are actually safe -- and that’s when it becomes a problem. 

In these cases, your nervous system has gotten “stuck” in danger mode. The whole world suddenly looks like it’s out to get you.

Cue the anxiety!

This is a big problem because “danger” can look like making new friends or business connections.

It can mean putting yourself out there for a promotion or going for a big new client.

It can shake your confidence -- literally, by giving you the jitters -- before your big competition.

Anxiety can tell you to stay small, play it safe, keep to your lane -- when what you really want is to reach for the stars.

Most anxiety treatments focus on changing your thoughts -- thinking positively, using affirmations, etc. 

Or, they might suggest taking a deep breath (hard to do when your diaphragm is frozen in fear -- and yes, this happens).

What we really need are methods to jolt your nervous system out of danger mode and back into safe and happy mode (assuming you’re not actually in physical danger, of course).

This doesn’t happen at the thought level -- it happens in your biology.

In your autonomic nervous system, to be exact.

Your vagus nerve is part of your autonomic nervous system and functions to help your body deal with stress.

This video gives you three vagus nerve exercises to rewire your anxious brain and bring you back to a centered state.

A NOTE

I’m normally against changing any of the words of the songs I cover, but since I arranged this medley for a wedding it didn’t seem fitting to start it off with “I may not always love you”…

♬

LYRICS

you know i’ll always love you
as long as there are stars above you
you’ll never need to doubt it
i’ll make you so sure about it
god only knows what i’d be without you

if you should ever leave me
though life would still go on, believe me
the world could show nothing to me
so what good would living do me?
god only knows what i’d be without you

some day, when i’m awfully low
when the world is cold
i will feel aglow just thinking of you
and the way you look tonight

you make me feel so young
you make me feel like spring has sprung
and every time i see you smile
i’m such a happy individual

the moment that you speak
i want to go play hide and seek
i want to go and bounce the moon
just like a toy balloon

i don’t want to leave her now
you know i believe, and how

that nothing compares
nothing compares to you
nothing compares
nothing compares to you

and i give you all of me
and you gave me all of you

and you can tell everybody that this is your song
it may be quite simple but now that it’s done
i hope you don’t mind, i hope you don’t mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is now you’re in the world

i don’t want to leave her now
you know i believe, and how

god only knows what i’d be without you

☺

00:00 - Intro
00:35 - Strength & Power Complex
01:45 - Hypertrophy Series
03:06 - Core Series
04:58 - Conditioning Complex


You don't need a gym filled with equipment to build serious muscle, strength, and conditioning. All you need is two dumbbells and a plan! I put together four complexes, each using nothing more than a pair of dumbbells and your body. Each complex will challenge you in a unique way. 

Complexes are great because they force you to complete a high-volume workout in a short amount of time. The key is to hang on to the weight until you've completed all the movements. No rest until you've finished a round! 

Once you've completed the warm-up, grab a set of dumbbells, and get your mind and some weights ready. The first time you do the routine, just work through each complex as best as you can, and don't worry if it feels a bit awkward or the weights you have aren't ideal.

If you have more than one pair of dumbbells available, you'll probably want increase or decrease the weight depending on the complex. In general, use as much weight as you can, but don't go so heavy you can't move well. Rest 2-3 minutes between complexes, and be ready to work.

| Complex 3: Core |
You may not see anything in the exercises listed below that screams ""core"" like, say, the hollow rock from my ""Quick Total-Body Workout,"" but trust me, you'll feel these where you should.

To make this work as a complex, perform all exercises with your right arm, rest 60 seconds, and then go through the exercises with your left arm. Keep your core tight the whole time!

During the snatch, keep your core tight and posture solid, even when you start breathing heavily. When performing the farmer's carry, your body will naturally want to lean away from the weight, but try to lean into the weight to keep your torso nice and straight.

The get-up sit-up, or half get-up, is a great exercise for your core and far less complex than the full get-up. Keep your eyes on the dumbbell and your shoulder locked into the socket. Push through your heel on the bent-leg side. When doing plank rows, I like to elevate my nonworking arm on a dumbbell so I get a full range of motion and don't sell myself out on the bottom of the movement. Widen your legs, which will help your hips square to the floor.

| Complex 4: Conditioning |
The final complex in this workout will test your conditioning. It may not look like much, but if you spend a little time in a split stance, you'll see why I use this as a finisher. When you're in a split stance, keep that back glute really tucked and tight and your torso vertical while you do the hammer curl. Switch legs before moving to the shoulder press.

During the split switch, try to keep your hips as low as possible. You'll get off the ground a little bit, but you don't want to be jumping around a lot. The key is to move your feet quickly and keep your torso nice and vertical.


| Implementing This Workout |
Perform this workout twice per week for 2-3 weeks, resting at least two days between the workouts. If you like the results, keep going with it! Once the workouts start to feel static, add weight or reps, or decrease the reps. Do whatever you can to challenge yourself every time!

This video has literally been years in the making, and it’s taken me the most time to create compared to any video on my channel. I really hope you like it! This routine is adapted from a talk I gave alongside Barbara Schildkrout, MD, and Kathy Niu, MD, at the 2021 Annual American Neuropsychiatric Association (ANPA) Conference. I’ve covered far more topics (in slightly less technical detail) in this version.

NOTE:
What if the card they picked is the mate of your key card? This isn't the worst case scenario, it's actually the best case scenario! Let's say the key card is the ten of spades. Before you go through the deck to take out a pair of cards, ask ""you didn't choose a black ten, did you?"" If they say ""no,"" carry on with the trick as usual. But if they say ""yes,"" you now know what card they chose. If it was a black ten, but it wasn't the ten of spades, they must have chosen the ten of clubs. So you can play it as if you are ""reading their mind."" You follow up with ""that's right, I thought so -- in fact, it was the ten of clubs!""

❤ Join the ""EmpathsRefuge"" and pick up cool perks on our Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/EmpathsRefuge

Hi everyone,
Narcissists are always attracted to empaths because empaths are the best persons to give them narcissistic supplies. Also, Narcissists enjoy being around empaths because they can feed off the empaths' positive energy.

This relationship can best be described as parasitic (one-sided). Only the narcissists benefit from the relationship, while the empaths suffer emotional, physical, and mental torture, and this happens as long as the empath remains in the relationship.

https://www.youtube.com/IMPOSSIBLESHOW?sub_confirmation=1 

It took me a while to come up with this. Quality may not be consistent, especially in the end of this amazing, and LIFE CHANGING audio track. 

This is an *Extended* Version of Tony’s “mini” Dicken’s Pattern exercise where Tony helps you remove your limiting beliefs and change your life once and for all. 

PLEASE NOTE: You may have to do this experimental exercise multiple times in order for it to be fully effective.

Feel free to skip my OWN intro and go straight to Tony if you’d like. 2:31

I also had to add a few things of my own after initial Tony’s to make it AS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL (the one he conducts during UPW event). UPW is Unleash the Power Within - Tony’s most popular seminar). 

⬇ some call it a guided meditation, others look at it as hypnosis ... I look at it mostly as Guided Meditation. 

GOOD LUCK AND PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU LIKE IT :) IN ADDITION, PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT I'M WORKING ON POWERTALK SERIES. IF YOU'D LIKE MORE CONTENT OF TONY ROBBINS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

Technology is always evolving and the real estate industry has always been at the forefront of technological advances. With the rise of blockchain technology, the impact on real estate will be felt by many in the future. 

With blockchain technology and real estate, smart contracts will make real estate transactions quicker, more efficient, and reduce fees for all parties involved when a real estate transaction is completed. This stretches from lawyers, to realtors, to appraisers. 

Blockchain real estate tokenization will allow greater liquidity compared to the legacy system we currently have in place. With groups like the International Blockchain Real Estate Association, they are bringing this technology and advancements to the real estate industry on a global scale 

The digitization of real estate is on our doorstep and it will be super interesting to see properties being sold off as fractional ownership allowing real estate investing to the masses and to a greater scale. 

The Blockchain will radically disrupt real estate.

This is our take on how Blockchain Technology,  Smart Contracts, and Tokenization will Disrupt Real Estate.

The goal of this channel is to think about crypto in a different way. Contrary to popular belief, crypto doesn't have to be, ""Buy and hope it goes up."" Through DeFi, there are so many ways to earn high & safe yields on your assets, which is a total game changer in terms of portfolio construction. 

Yield farming is not a ""get rich quick scheme,"" but rather a ""slow grind to more wealth"" strategy. And I argue that USING DeFi is the best way to LEARN DeFi, which will present natural alpha for you in the future. I am not an ecosystem maxi, but a yield maxi. If an ecosystem presents a good risk-adjusted yield, I will be there. Subscribe to follow my journey!

ugFNFq8OSgE,Live Jelly Cam - Monterey Bay Aquarium,Monterey Bay Aquarium,UCnM5iMGiKsZg-iOlIO2ZkdQ,"Get an up-close look at the delicate sea nettles in our Open Sea exhibit.

Watch as their long tentacles and lacey mouth-arms move smoothly through the water. But don't let these unassuming invertebrates fool you—their graceful trailing parts are covered in stinging cells used for hunting. When their tentacles touch tiny drifting prey, the stinging cells paralyze it and stick tight. The prey is moved to the mouth-arms and then to the mouth, where it's digested.

Your money in Crypto and Defi is at risk.
Today we will learn why when you use a ""hot wallet"" like MetaMask, you might lose all your tokens.
We will learn all the dangers of using a metamask wallet, and how a potential hacker can steal the private key/seed phrase of your metamask wallet.
Once the hacker has your private key he can steal all your funds from all the different blockchains.
If you have staked tokens in DEFI apps he can also unstake them and steal them as well, the same applied to NFTs.
We will understand how hackers operate and how we can level up our security to avoid such incidents.

The solution is using a hardware wallet (Ledger device for example) when you interact with DEFI apps and smart contracts.

-_uwheTZwUw,Sleep Hypnosis Fall Asleep in Minutes Sleep Talk Down with All Night Rain Sounds (8 Hours),Michael Sealey,UC9GoqHypa-SDrGPMyeBkjKw,"Welcome to this sleep hypnosis to fall asleep in minutes with all night rain sounds. This spoken sleep talk down with relaxing sleep music and cosy falling rain will help you find a rapid and deep sleep, every night. Use this sleep hypnosis to help you fall asleep fast with progressive relaxation, as you completely unwind in mind and body, and enjoy a whole, calming night of slumber time's rainy serenity for your long lasting, easiest sleep. 

In this sleep hypnosis, you'll first be hearing the sounds of my spoken voice suggestions, accompanied with relaxing sleep music and the sounds of gently falling rain. Once you are completely settled and guided into your deep sleep states of rest and peace, you'll hear my voice and music soon fade away, leaving you with only the blissful sleeping ambience of many comforting hours of all night, cosy rain.   

This bedtime sleep session combines aspects of self hypnosis, guided meditation, mind and body relaxation, and guided visualization for your fastest sleep and deepest healing, to allow you a progressive sense of drifting into your sanctuary of safest comfort and restful dreams.

Listen along and allow yourself to relax deeply, as you learn how to let go of physical tensions in the body, as well as melt away unwanted stresses or worries in the mind. Reduce the effects of overthinking, as you turn down any excessive noise of the mind's chatter, by more easily resting into a deep sleep at every bedtime. 

I hope you enjoy this guided sleep hypnosis and talk down to fall asleep in minutes with all night rain. Thank you for listening :)

Lyrics:
At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me, at the dark end of the street
You and me
 
I know that time is gonna take its toll
We have pay for the love we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
Oh, our love keeps coming on strong
Steal away, to the dark end of the street
 
They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us, oh someday
You and me, at the dark end of the street
You and me
 
And when the daylight hour rolls around
And by chance we're both downtown
If we should meet, just walk on by
Oh darling, please don't cry
 
Tonight we'll meet
At the dark end of the street, mmm mmm

The goal of this channel is to think about crypto in a different way. Contrary to popular belief, crypto doesn't have to be, ""Buy and hope it goes up."" Through DeFi, there are so many ways to earn high & safe yields on your assets, which is a total game changer in terms of portfolio construction. 

Yield farming is not a ""get rich quick scheme,"" but rather a ""slow grind to more wealth"" strategy. And I argue that USING DeFi is the best way to LEARN DeFi, which will present natural alpha for you in the future. I am not an ecosystem maxi, but a yield maxi. If an ecosystem presents a good risk-adjusted yield, I will be there. Subscribe to follow my journey!

BSC DaPPs are smart contracts built on the Binance Smart chain. BNB is the currency used to engage in the different smart contracts.  DaPPs refer to Decentralized Applications. The most popular extension to interact with these dapps is MetaMask.
 High Risk ROI dapps are smart contracts that use a ""first in, first to get paid"" system. 
Yield Farming / Staking are smart contracts that use your crypto currency as liquidity for the market. In exchange, you are paid a portion of the transaction fees. Liquidity pools deal with impermanent loss while staking is simply subject to price depreciation. 
DeFi is short for Decentralized Finance and entails everything written above as well as many other topics. Its IMPORTANT to do your own research.

The goal of this channel is to think about crypto in a different way. Contrary to popular belief, crypto doesn't have to be, ""Buy and hope it goes up."" Through DeFi, there are so many ways to earn high & safe yields on your assets, which is a total game changer in terms of portfolio construction. 

Yield farming is not a ""get rich quick scheme,"" but rather a ""slow grind to more wealth"" strategy. And I argue that USING DeFi is the best way to LEARN DeFi, which will present natural alpha for you in the future. I am not an ecosystem maxi, but a yield maxi. If an ecosystem presents a good risk-adjusted yield, I will be there. Subscribe to follow my journey!

0tJrla31t8I,Raoul Pal's Introduction to the Exponential Age,Real Vision,UCGXWKlq1Oxr3ddEtmKhAkPg,"🔥 Get FREE ACCESS to Real Vision https://rvtv.io/3Y4t5Pw. Raoul Pal returns in his role as the founder of Global Macro Investor to update Real Vision members on the exponentially large role crypto is playing within his macro framework. 

Raoul argues that crypto is a ""black hole"" that is sucking in all of the world's talent and value at a speed that no one can comprehend and that its capacity to generate phenomenal returns for investors is not temporary but rather part of a durable long-term trend that is at the vanguard of what he calls ""The Exponential Age."" 

Raoul contends that since central banks have suppressed the volatility of currencies and interest rates, large ""macro"" on heavy swings in these variables no longer offer the opportunity they once did and that it is in the world of crypto where these outsized returns can be found. Filmed on April 10, 2021. Key learnings: Raoul sees the migration of value to the digital world as an exponential trend that offers opportunities for investment returns that are no longer possible in traditional capital markets.

TPZVs9KLJrU,SELF-MASTERY: ENERGY | Erwin McManus - MOSAIC,Mosaic,UCz9PqE5Qr9avopAPkfCZcSQ,"In this final installment to his ‘Self-Mastery’ series, Pastor Erwin helps us understand one of the most valuable and precious resources God designed us both to give and to receive – our energy.

Anchored in Luke 8:40-48, Pastor Erwin draws a parallel between our lives and the story of Jesus engaging a woman whose faith drew on his power. Her clear intention that Jesus could heal her caused an energy transfer that Jesus not only felt, but declared an action of great faith. If your life feels constantly depleted of energy, or you want to better funnel a surplus of energy in a positive direction, this talk will empower and transform you.

Don’t miss out on how you can achieve self-mastery and walk in God’s purpose for your life, with this powerful conclusion to an incredible series!

Ethereum wallets allow you to hold Ether as well as to write smart contracts. Beginners will be better off using wallets that do not allow smart wallet functionality as they are much simpler to use. 

The best Ethereum wallets for beginners are:
Ledger
TREZOR
MyEtherWallet (MEW) 
Exodus
Edge

If you are looking for a smart contract wallet (also known as a full node) take a look at Mist.

Gas is the unit used to measure how much transaction fee you'll need to pay. It is calculated according to the complexity of your requested action and the traffic across the Ethereum network.

It's got nightlife and parts that will end your life at night.

Miami Beach is a coastal resort city in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. It was incorporated on March 26, 1915. The municipality is located on natural and man-made barrier islands between the Atlantic Ocean and Biscayne Bay, the latter of which separates the Beach from the mainland city of Miami. The neighborhood of South Beach, comprising the southernmost 2.5 square miles (6.5 km2) of Miami Beach, along with downtown Miami and the Port of Miami, collectively form the commercial center of South Florida. Miami Beach's estimated population is 88,885 according to the most recent United States census estimates. Miami Beach is the 26th largest city in Florida based on official 2019 estimates from the US Census Bureau. It has been one of America's pre-eminent beach resorts since the early 20th century.

In 1979, Miami Beach's Art Deco Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Art Deco District is the largest collection of Art Deco architecture in the world and comprises hundreds of hotels, apartments and other structures erected between 1923 and 1943. Mediterranean, Streamline Moderne and Art Deco are all represented in the District. The Historic District is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the East, Lenox Court on the West, 6th Street on the South and Dade Boulevard along the Collins Canal to the North. The movement to preserve the Art Deco District's architectural heritage was led by former interior designer Barbara Baer Capitman, who now has a street in the District named in her honor.

Can you imagine being one of the first investors in Google, Facebook, Amazon, or Microsoft?! 🤯 

According to Jeff Bezos, the Founder and CEO of Amazon, the first 20 or so outside investors put in around $50,000 apiece for a stake of a little less than 1% of the company at the time. If those early investors had held on to their entire stakes, and those stakes had never been diluted by later investors, they would be $3.5 billion today — a return of 70,000x! 

***What is an Angel Investor?***
An individual who provides capital to an early stage company, usually the first outside investment to support the entrepreneur grow their business. This investment decision can be fueled by one of three main ways: 1) to support the entrepreneur, 2) solve the problem the business is solving, 3) make a financial return. Ideally all three of these come into play when making an angel investment.

YgOYLDf5Wv8,If I Hadn't Caught It On Camera You Wouldn't Have Believed Me,Yappy Beeman   ,UCMxMK8p95f-5mWEEDKLA8WA,"copyright 2021 by Travis Ulbrich Aka YappyBeeman (tm) All Rights Reserved

Another awesome day in North Alabama today friends.    After  really rough day yesterday,  with tornadoes running all through the state, we are out catching a huge honeybee swarm from a cedar tree.   
  I can't believe  it myself that this is the second swarm I've caught so far and both queens were captured before I ever shook the branch.  This is really making swarm catching fun.  
   I hope you all are enjoying my 2021 Bee season kickoff with these swarm shakes.  I sure am.   I believe  it puts me ahead of my buddy's  Jpthebeeman, 628DirtRooster and Jeff Horchoff.   Although I know they will catch up quick, it's nice to lead the race at some point.   
    Enjoy everyone and I hope you enjoyed a little fun from Yappybeeman.

 I get calls like this all the time, something flying in a small hole and it looks like bees or yellow jacket wasps. sometimes even for a squirrel or a raccoon. I enjoy every new experience when it comes to removing bees from structures. Construction obstacles always seem to challenge me with every job. As a bee remover, I find the good and bad in construction design. Some things look great but make it easy for bees to set up shop and call it home also. Other times, bees move in due to a lack of home maintainace. But no matter the reason, Yappy Beeman is ready to come rescue the honey bees. 

 Check out my friends video channels also. Jpthebeeman , 628Dirtroosterbees and Jeff Horchoff for some more great honey bee videos.

Yappy Beeman is a professional bee remover  performing  live honey bee removals in Alabama as ""Alabama Bee Rescue"" and relocates them to apiaries away from residential areas so they can rebuild and thrive as a honey bee colony producing honey. Yappy is an Alabama Beekeepers association member that has performed over 500 live bee removals. Yappy with the help of his great friend and mentor; JpTheBeeman, a professional beekeeper , has learned many skills to remove bee swarms and honey bee colonies safely for the bees and homeowners alike.",2021-03-26T21:27:10Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgOYLDf5Wv8,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YgOYLDf5Wv8/hqdefault.jpg,PT7M19S,37055764,555340,52824

We're standing with women from all walks of life and breaking the silence because with knowledge comes power. Every woman goes through her own unique menopause experience. By sharing your stories, we can break the stigma and eliminate the feelings of isolation. Together, we gain control over our menopause journey.

Menopause is not a series of symptoms but a transition that all women will go through, some more intense than others. Telling stories that help women know that they are not alone in their journey can be empowering! Women all over the world are taking control of their narrative and seeing that it is possible to be optimistic and powerful during and post-menopause. @Mygennev is here to change the narrative.",2021-03-28T21:08:20Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwThI2V25mc,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GwThI2V25mc/hqdefault.jpg,PT1M34S,3615,52,2

KqNgYdgzLHE,3 Workflows for Personal Productivity in ClickUp (+ What I'm Changing in 2021),Layla at ProcessDriven,UCDr-9ViL8OpJsOXXrY1bbOw,"Every month, we have a theme for the content we release inside ClickingUp (and, in part, on YouTube). 

This month -- based on some requests from ClickingUp members -- we're going to be talking about personal productivity in ClickUp.  Or -- to put it in less jargon-y terms -- ""What's the next best thing I should #focus on?""

To kick things off on the virtual whiteboard this month, I'm going to be going live to break down my 2020 workflow for determining my focus. Like we do with every workflow, I'll then identify the gaps and problems in this workflow before I explain the modified workflow I'm trying in 2021.

While this isn't the type of business processes we typically think of when we're talking about ""systemizing your business"" it's probably one of the most important #workflows for any individual -- whether you're an entrepreneur or employee!

Finally, we'll wrap up with a brief discussion of what I'd need to do to translate this workflow into a #ClickUp template/structure...but we'll save the deep-dive on that conversation for a later conversation inside ClickingUp Community (processdriven.co/#services) when we release our next monthly template.

(This video isn't specifically focused on personal USE (aka organizing your personal life) -- more so personal FOCUS -- but if you'd like to see more videos on that side of things just let me know!)

sEKTgarfHLk,How BUSINESS MODEL changes the ClickUp Hierarchy (Space vs. Folder. vs. List vs. Task),Layla at ProcessDriven,UCDr-9ViL8OpJsOXXrY1bbOw,"The ClickUp Hierarchy (deciding if your project should be a Space, Folder, List, or Task in ClickUp) is hard enough...but did you know the ""right choice"" will depend heavily on your BUSINESS MODEL, not just your team size?

That's right.

Organizing #ClickUp for ecommerce requires a different setup than how you'd maintain your online #membership on ClickUp. And if you also do custom consulting? Well...it gets complex.

If you're a business with multiple income streams sporting multiple products and services, it's important to remember that you'll need to craft context for EACH of these business structures within your ClickUp Workspace.

In this ClickUp #training, I'll go through some of the most common business models and an example way we'd structure that business model inside ClickUp. 

(These examples are just EXAMPLES -- I am NOT suggesting there is one ""right way"" based on industry alone. There are MANY variables that go into making this decision which we spell out in our Decision Tree inside ClickingUp for members.)

In this video, we cover:
00:00 - Introduction
03:08 - What do you do?
07:14 - What is ClickUp Hierarchy?
11:33 - Where does your business fall in the ClickUp Hierarchy? (Incorporating your business model, process, team size, and aesthetic preference into your decision)
14:46 - LIVE Questions: ""Are the emojis in your list a setting like colors, or are they in your last names and did you deactivate colors?""
15:54 - 3 Options to help you choose which hierarchy is right for your business.
16:36 - Option #1: Trial and Error
20:01 - Option #2: Layla's Shortcut
29:07 - LIVE Question: ""Can I sync between two accounts? (Personal and work accounts.)
30:40 - Option #3: DIY with a Process Org Chart
33:19 - LIVE Question: ""Is it better to align your business functions with biz-ops, hr., finance, IT, to a space first?""
34:26 - Examples of each option to help you choose your ClickUp Hierarchy.
44:52 - LIVE Question: ""What's the advantage of placing all recurring tasks, for all clients, in one list rather than separating by folders for each client?""
47:15 - LIVE Question: ""What's your recommendation for project-based clients?""
49:00 - LIVE Question: ""How do you feel about building ClickUp out as if the employee already exists, separating tasks by job before separate people actually have that job?""
1:01:36 - LIVE Question: ""Do you recommend attaching files in ClickUp or a file storage like GDrive?""
1:02:00 - Key Takeaways

https://goldfrapp.lnk.to/supernature20

Originally released in 2005, Supernature defined a new era of electronic pop, featuring classics like “Ooh La La,” “Number 1,” and “Ride A White Horse.” The deluxe reissue includes the remastered album, B-sides, unreleased live sessions, brand new remixes, and a Blu-ray 5.1 surround mix.

With fresh reinterpretations by Alison Goldfrapp & Will Gregory, Richard X, and Sun’s Signature (Elizabeth Fraser & Damon Reece), this release reaffirms Supernature’s lasting influence — a shimmering, high-gloss vision of pop at its most seductive and strange.

9DiPwuOWKRc,The Coolest Par 3 Golf Course in the World,Sharper Golf,UCyFV-uArADvYZ7rOhFzUSOw,"At Wickenburg Ranch in Wickenburg Arizona, they have a hidden gem golf course called Little Wick. It is the coolest Par 3 Golf Course in the World. 

Course Info:  http://www.wickenburgranch.com/lil-wick-9-hole/
Follow on Instagram for Daily Content: @sharpergolf_
Follow me on Facebook: SharperGolf

The Par 3 golf course is built on a large rocky hill that is a few minute golf cart drive from the clubhouse. The Little Wick has a very casual atmosphere that takes the pressure off of playing golf and encourages you to just have fun. In the center of the course is an outdoor bar and grill where you can have lunch and grab a drink, or just sit outside and relax and enjoy the sites. 

The casual atmosphere is all encompassing, there is no dress code. I noticed people playing in shorts and flip flops.  I believe the local residents can play this course for free.  There were entire families of 8 - 10 people including small kids playing as a single group. This didn't seem to slow down play at all for my group.  We just took it easy and played at a moderate pace and still finished in around 1 hour and 10 minutes. 

The course has speakers setup on the Tee boxes and greens and they play (at least on this day) music from the 70's and 80's which gives the golf course a really relaxed feel.  

I played this Par 3 course in the afternoon after I had played the Big Wick full 18 hole course in the morning.  I didn't play particularly well on the Big Wick, so I wan't expecting to hit many greens on the Little Wick, but I surprised myself and played rather well.  I think the relaxed atmosphere and great company helped me play better.  

I played with a delightful retired couple that lives in the community. They had played the Little Wick many times and shared all of their local knowledge with me.  Which really helped me when it came to club selection.  Nick has even made a Hole in One on this course before.  They were great fun to play golf with and I really appreciated them letting me film the round and how welcoming and nice they were.  

I highly recommend playing Wickenburg Ranch The Big Wick and Little Wick. If you plan a trip to the Phoenix / Scottsdale area you need to add Wickenburg Ranch to your list. It a bit of a drive, but well worth it.  Of all the Top Courses I've played in Arizona, the Big Wick is my new Favorite.  

This Golf VLOG is different from my normal style of VLOG and hope you enjoy the music and descriptions of my play.  Leave me a comment below and let me know if you like it.  

I hope you enjoy the video.

WTCrgFVJUBE,Why do Microgreens Need Weight? Kale Microgreens Germination Trial |  Indoor farming |,On The Grow,UCcqnIHnK-75WdpaVPQOUxtw,"😄Why Do Microgreens Need Weight during germination!? Well, in this video, we wanted to demonstrate how Kale microgreens germinate differently depending on the amount of weight applied and type of cover used during germination! 

✅ 🌱For this demonstration, we compare 4 trays side-by-side. One tray had nothing on top, the second tray had just a damp paper towel, the third had an empty tray on top and the last tray had 7lbs on top. The results & comparison of each group just might shock you a bit, because it really does make a difference in your Microgreen grows!!

cVRB3uP1-VY,The SECRET to sharpening a SERRATED BLADE is SANDPAPER and a SCREWDRIVER! no special tools required!,Guns and Guitars,UCnfXz2OeVJHYyebACjj4ZGA,"If you get frustrated trying to sharpen a serrated blade, this hack is for you!  NO SPECIAL TOOLS REQUIRED! Just sandpaper, screw drivers (or other round shaped tools), a piece of denim or canvas, and some polishing compound, and honestly it takes about the same amount of time as sharpening a plain edge knife!  I also use a diamond pen sharpener on REALLY ABUSED blades (like this example) but if you haven't ruined your blade like I did for the sake of this video, you can skip to the sandpaper at 5:51 

Here are the knife and tools I used in this video:

MY6nKL59L1o,How to Lose “Stubborn” Belly Fat (GONE IN 4 STEPS!),ATHLEAN-X™,UCe0TLA0EsQbE-MjuHXevj2A,"If you want to see how to lose stubborn belly fat and get rid of it once and for all, then this is a video that you don’t want to miss. Here I’m going to ask you 4 tough but important questions that you will need to answer honestly. When you do however, I can promise you that you will lose your belly fat for good and never have to worry about it coming back again.

Losing fat is one of the easiest and hardest things to do when it comes to getting in shape. This is because science makes it very clear what the process is. The issue however is that sticking to what science says we should do can become challenging and fat loss can stall pretty quickly. That said, the first thing we all must do is look in the mirror. No, not to look at the areas where you are storing your stubborn fat like on your belly, hips or love handles.

Instead, you need to look in the mirror to face the tough assessment that is often times needed to get over the hump. You first must be willing to address the “how to lose stubborn belly fat” question. Is it really stubborn? Meaning, are you carrying just too much fat around your waist because your overall body fat levels are high or are we talking about the last few percentage points of fat levels that stick around despite your best and most consistent efforts.

If it’s the former, then increasing the consistency with which you do the right thing will quickly get you to the next level of fat loss. If however you believe you are doing everything you can but still can’t seem to get to the lean ripped level you want to be, then the additional questions will help to dig into the “why”.

We start with drinking. I understand that the desire to drink is driven far more by social benefits than it is by simply trying to quench your thirst. For this reason, it is often something that many people are unwilling to forgo. I can tell you this however. With the rapid pace that one is able to consume and pile up liquid calories along with the metabolic impact that alcohol has on your ability to burn fat, drinking is always going to make it more difficult to get ripped and lean and to lose body fat than not drinking.

That said, you have to ask yourself how important it is for you to have a six pack. If that doesn’t mean as much to you as partaking in certain social activities then you will have to find the balance that makes you most happy. This is going to be individual for everyone and nobody should place their expectations on you, me included.

Next we have to discuss your nutrition. No pursuit of fat loss can occur without a frank discussion about what you are consuming every day. In order to lose fat you have to be in a calorie deficit, period. How you get there however, is very important. If you use crash diets and carbohydrate exclusion methods, you are likely never going to see the long term success you should in trying to lose fat and will be unhappy when you put back on any weight lost.

If you are in a deficit but still have to lose belly fat, then you have to assess three other areas discussed in this video. The first is the cleanliness of your diet. How healthy are you really eating? Often times, this is not as good as you may think it is. If however you insist that it is good but you have more fat to lose then you next must evaluate your portion sizes. If this is good still, then you have nothing left but to be honest about your consistency. Here is where an assessment of your cheat meal frequency comes in.

From here, your training must be evaluated. You must train. Diet alone is never going to be enough when it comes to losing belly fat forever. A training plan that consists of more than just cardio is necessary if you want to build lean muscle tissue capable of helping to increase your metabolism and get you burning more calories more easily. Here is where 3-5 time per week weight training with an inclusion of barbell complexes is ideal.

Finally, ab training is something you will want to do as well. Not because there are any spot reduction benefits of this but because when these muscles are developed you get a visual impact that often helps to motivate you to keep doing more of the other things mentioned earlier.

Paint polishing is usually split in two steps: compound and polish.  Paint polishing is a car detailing technique used to remove defects in the paint through paint correction.  By removing a thin layer of clear coat, you’ll remove scratches, swirls marks, marring and oxidation, get better clarity from your paint, make the color of the paint “pop” and make it more glossy and shiny.  By levelling the clear coat through paint polishing, you’re allowing light to bounce off better thus increasing the gloss levels.

This deep sleep hypnosis experience is a form of guided sleep meditation, with spoken suggestions for complete relaxation, accompanied with a soothing soundscape of gentle background sleeping music and calming ocean waves.

This bedtime hypnotic session combines aspects of self hypnosis, guided meditation, mind and body relaxation, and guided visualization to allow you a serene sense of floating and drifting into blissfully tranquil, positive dreams.

Listen along and allow yourself to relax deeply, as you learn how to let go of physical tensions in the body, as well as melt away unwanted stresses or worries in the mind. Reduce the effects of overthinking, as you turn down any excessive noise of the mind's chatter, by more easily resting into deep peace at every bedtime. 

I hope you relax and enjoy this positive journey towards your deep sleep rest :)

Q1Osb5rqPCs,"Virtual Choir Hallelujah Chorus -- Easter 2020, Worship In Exile",Kyle Turver,UCOxMJI8f5AiBFRSfiV2ebyA,"Every year our church—Bethany Presbyterian Church in Seattle Washington— ends our Easter services with an invitation to come forward and join the choir in singing Handel's Hallelujah Chorus. People stream forward and pack onto the chancel. I count it off and away we go. Every year—in all of it's rough-around-the-edges beauty—this impromptu performance is one of the most hopeful, fun events of my year. The first time I had the pleasure of directing this mass of people I nearly cried through the whole thing. 

As churches are shuttered due to COVID-19, I wanted to find a way for this tradition to live on. A number of choir members had sent me the virtual choir videos that have been circulating online and I realized we could do this for the Hallelujah Chorus. I offered an invitation to the choir and other singers I know, much like I do in worship every Easter. This time it was via email. What you have here is our 2020 Hallelujah chorus ritual. I hope seeing all these faces together reminds you that someday, our hallelujahs will will echo together in person.

I am grateful to all the people who made this wild idea possible and for all the singers who were brave enough to send me videos of just their face and voice singing their part of the Hallelujah Chorus. Thanks you, and great job!",2020-04-12T16:00:21Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1Osb5rqPCs,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q1Osb5rqPCs/hqdefault.jpg,PT4M8S,14673,314,27

Here I show you 29 home exercise hacks that you can use in any home workout to train your entire body without missing a beat. Just because you can’t get to a gym to get your workouts in doesn’t mean that you can’t effectively train your body.

All you have to do is open your eyes to the possibilities in your immediate surrounding. Many people think that they don’t have enough room or money to afford a good home gym. That’s not true. You can do so many exercises that you may never have realized you could just by using some handy pieces of equipment around your house.

The first is your staircase. In the gym, either a bench or a plyometric box is used to perform lower body step up variations, box jumps and even lunge combinations. The stairway in your own house or apartment complex can be just as useful. You even have the option of stepping up one or two stairs at a time to decrease or increase the difficulty as needed. The upper body can be worked too, such as using it to perform decline pushups for your upper chest.

The kitchen is also an amazing place to find new exercise opportunities. For instance, if you have a corner to your kitchen counter you can do all sorts of dips (for the chest or triceps) as well as hanging ab exercises. Instead of having to hang on a bar at the gym to perform hanging leg raises or knee raises for example, you can simply support your body in the corner and do the exact same movements without having to sacrifice the benefits.

Ever thought about using your hardwood or tile floors to your advantage in your workouts? This is one of the best ways to get your posterior chain muscles fired up. Take off your shoes and leave your socks on. Perform exercises like the hamstring bridge and curl to make your glutes and hams work in concert as intended. Turn over and perform upper body pulldowns for your lats, an area that is often hard to work when you don’t have the normal equipment options from the gym.

Don’t underestimate the value of your doorway either. As long as you have a solid door jamb, you can use it to perform either pullups or chinups. The extra benefit of the climbers grip makes it even more demanding than a normal pullup on your forearm and gripping muscles. The door jamb itself can be used to work your shoulders too. Both the deltoids and the rotator cuff can be trained by either an isometric lateral raise or the home face pull variation just covered in a recent video.

If you are looking for replacements for the dumbbells or weights that you would use at a gym there are actually plenty. One of my favorites is a poland spring water jug. When full, these weigh in at 40 pounds. This can be used for biceps curl variations, one arm shoulder cleans and even shoulder pressing over and back. The extra benefit of the sloshing of the water is that it demands more muscle stability and control throughout the explosive movements making them even more challenging.

Broomsticks, tupperware lids and even your own computer are other helpful things laying around your house that can be turned into exercise machines by the time this video is over. Don’t be afraid to explore all of them. If you are looking for a complete home workout program that you can do without any equipment at all, and have a step by step meal plan included as well, be sure to check out the ATHLEAN XERO program at athleanx.com at the link below.

Welcome to this guided meditation which is designed to train your mind for calm detachment from any unwanted patterns of over-thinking.  

By practicing these mindful techniques of conscious observation and self acceptance, you will find you are more able to quieten and relax an overly active mind -- and also naturally increase your body's healthy energy, to become a more self assured person in the present moment. 

This meditation experience may be repeated as often as you choose to reinforce your positive intentions.

By your own inner direction may you continue to find your greatest waking potential.

This session is suitable and recommended for repeated listening, and regular listening will help compound positive suggestions and / or your own positive results.  

The end of this session will provide options for either drifting into a sound night's sleep, or for returning to your fully conscious, awake and alert, positive mind state.

Do not listen to this recording whilst driving or operating machinery. 

This recording is in no way a replacement for any prescribed medication; nor is it intended to contraindicate or supersede any medically diagnosed conditions. Please always consult your health care professional for your best advice in all medical issues. 

All hypnosis is self hypnosis. The power for positive change resides within your own mind. If you choose to accept the suggestions presented in this session, you can rest comfortably knowing that you are the one safely in control of your own positive experience.

This channel uses positive voice suggestions, often accompanied with calm images, background sounds and meditation music, to allow you your very best state of relaxation, inner change, to remove negative blocks, and to create self guided healing therapy; with techniques from the fields of hypnotherapy, modern psychotherapy, trance work, guided relaxation, NLP, cognitive behavioural psychology, mindfulness meditation, and ASMR.

Peace & Enjoy

P.S. Please LINK & SHARE this video with those who you think might benefit from positive hypnosis and guided meditation. Thank you.

rJ56DPoGP38,Cultivate Joy and Happiness: 20 Minute Guided Mindfulness Meditation | Mindful Movement,The Mindful Movement,UCu_mPlZbomAgNzfAUElRL7w,"Enjoy this 20-minute guided mindfulness meditation to cultivate joy and happiness using Loving Kindness.  Although it may not always feel like it, joy can be your choice rather than a condition of if something happens or if you get something, then you experience joy.  

For today, let go of the “I’ll be happy when…” mindset.  See your joy as available to you just on the other side of a door, you simply need to open it and let joy into your heart.  Today, bring joy intentionally into your world and heart.  Find ease in stressful or challenging times and spread joy to your loved ones and around the world.

'As It Is (In Heaven)'
Words and Music by Joel Houston & Ben Fielding
© 2016 Hillsong Music Publishing
CCLI: 7068429

LYRICS:

VERSE 1:
Whether now or then
Death is not my end
I know heaven waits for me
Though the road seems long
I'll never walk alone
I’ve got all I need to sing

PRE-CHORUS:
I know You love me
I know You found me
I know You saved me
And Your grace will never fail me
And while I’m waiting
I’m not waiting
I know heaven lives in me

VERSE 2:
Should I suffer long
This is not my home
I know heaven waits for me
Though the night is dark
Heaven owns my heart
I’ve got all I need to sing

CHORUS:
So I will sing like I will there
In the fearless light of glory
Where the darkness cannot find me
And Your face is all I see
I will sing like a man
With no sickness in my body
Like no prison walls can hold me
I will sing like I am free

BRIDGE:
I’ll sing holy holy
My heart cries holy
As it is in heaven
It is in me
We’ll sing holy holy
The earth cries holy
As it is in heaven
So let it be

He’s outspoken, passionate, stylish, and— probably because he’s outspoken, passionate and stylish—is no stranger to criticism. He pastors celebrities, athletes and one of the most influential churches in America. Listen in as he and Cameron talk candidly about the criticism after his appearance on The View, the pressure of representing the Church in mainstream culture, dealing with critics, his views on life issues, racism, justice, grace and truth.

VERSE 1:
There’s a grace when the heart is under fire 
Another way when the walls are closing in 
And when I look at the space between 
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

CHORUS 1:
There was another in the fire 
Standing next to me
There was another in the waters 
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
Of how I’ve been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden 
Where another died for me

TAG:
There is another in the fire

VERSE 2:
All my debt left for dead beneath the waters 
I’m no longer a slave to my sin anymore 
And should I fall in the space between 
What remains of me and this reckoning 
Either way I won’t bow
To the things of this world
And I know I will never be alone

CHORUS 2:
There is another in the fire 
Standing next to me
There is another in the waters 
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding 
What power set me free
There is a grave that holds no body 
And now that power lives in me

BRIDGE:
And I can see the light in the darkness 
As the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin
I can feel the ground shake beneath us 
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between us

VERSE 3:
There is no other name
But the Name that is Jesus
He who was and still is
And will be through it all
So come what may in the space between 
All the things unseen and this reckoning 
I know I will never be alone

CHORUS 3:
There’ll be another in the fire 
Standing next to me
There’ll be another in the waters 
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding 
How good You’ve been to me
I’ll count the joy come every battle 
‘Cause I know that’s where You’ll be

As You Find Me
Word and Music by Joel Houston, Matt Crocker & Benjamin Hastings
© 2018 Hillsong Music Publishing 
CCLI: 7124065

VERSE 1:
I’ve been strong
And I’ve been broken within a moment 
I’ve been faithful
And I’ve been reckless at every bend 
I’ve held everything together
And watched it shatter
I’ve stood tall and I have crumbled
In the same breath

VERSE 2:
I have wrestled
And I have trembled toward surrender 
Chased my heart adrift
And drifted home again
Plundered blessing
Till I’ve been desperate to find redemption 
And every time I turn around
Lord You’re still there

PRE-CHORUS 1:
I was found
Before I was lost
I was Yours
Before I was not
Grace to spare
For all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me

CHORUS:
And I know I don’t deserve this kind of love 
Somehow this kind of love is who You are 
It’s a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
But somehow
You love me as You find me

VERSE 3:
Who am I
To think Your glory needs my praises 
But if this borrowed breath is Yours Lord 
Take it all
You are faithful and You are gracious 
And I’m just grateful
To think You don’t need a single thing 
And still You want my heart

PRE-CHORUS 2:
I was found
Before I was lost
I was Yours
Before I was not
You wear the scars
For all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me

TAG:
Your love’s too good to leave me here

BRIDGE:
If You want my heart
I won’t second guess
‘Cause I need Your love
More than anything
I’m in
I’m Yours
Your love’s too good to leave me here 
Your love’s too good to leave me

WtbVZHxuxZU,"How To Do Affiliate Marketing With Paid Facebook Advertising, The Right Way! Mess This Up & You Fail",Miles Beckler,UC7RZRFCrN4XKoMsy5MgJKrg,"Having troubles making money with affiliate marketing running Facebook ads?  This video holds the super affiliate secret to success! NEW UPDATE: Get my NEW 🏆 Affiliate Marketing Crash Course 🏆 for FREE, here: https://www.milesbeckler.com/free-affiliate-course 

I've broken down everything I did in order to build, launch and grow a brand new affiliate site to over $3500/mo in profit in simple step-by-step format... It's 100% beginner friendly and of course, it's yours 100% free...  Because my lifestyle is supported by my affiliate sites NOT from selling you courses... 👍

If you are new to the world of affiliate marketing and you are wondering how to earn income as an affiliate, be sure to watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tD97-K5TeE

For help with the actual structure (and creation) of an affiliate marketing funnel is simple... This video shows that marketing funnel in detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV-lq5Popvo

To build out a funnel like that is also quite simple...

How to build a funnel video series is here and the affiliate marketing funnel is covered in video 1: https://m.youtube.com/watch?list=PL0sOKzn__yK3iOONk6-QP0Se2G23ZcuWL&v=YsUNFZhqkEA

The theory behind running paid Facebook advertising is also quite simple!

The how to advertise on Facebook videos are here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?list=PL0sOKzn__yK2WLfPcyzwnULUV3uy8031s&v=XYY6zn3c8Xk

So if the funnel and the traffic side are both simple, why is affiliate marketing with Facebook ads so difficult?

The real answer is because most people are not patient enough to invest the time and energy needed to build a true relationship with a visitor...

This is the key to making money with affiliate marketing as explained in great detail in this post here: https://www.milesbeckler.com/make-money-with-affiliate-marketing/

They are trying to bypass the process of growing an email list and developing a relationship with the subscriber and they are going for the sale way too soon...

Often direct linking people from the facebook ad to the affiliate program which is a recipe for disaster in the affiliate marketing world.

Honoring the relationship you create with every single subscriber is so key to success with Facebook ads and affiliate marketing.

You may think that linking someone from a Facebook advertisement to your affiliate link for a Clickbank product is a 'short cut' bit you are setting yourself up for failure.

I know... Because I made this costly affiliate marketing rookie mistake years ago.

I'm trying to help you learn from my mistakes and show you the right way to do affiliate marketing with Facebook!

Although this video may seem simple, the true secret to success with affiliate marketing is in this video.

Whether you are using facebook advertising, content marketing or organic facebook traffic to fill your affiliate marketing funnel with traffic, leads and prospects... The game is the same.

You must bring value to the marketplace and help your personal brand stand out so you become a trusted advisor to the people you are connecting with through your advertising.

The mechanism to truly develop this relationship is your email list which is why focusing on growing your email list and being of value to your email list is vitally important to your success as an affiliate marketer.

If you want help with ""how to do email marketing as an affiliate"" be sure to check out the email marketing video I did with my wife where she reveals a powerful autoresponder series that you can use to get going!

What Exactly Is A Dark Post On Facebook And Why is The Best WAy TO Advertise

With the holiday buying season about to kick into full swing, it's vital that you use every piece of arsenal you have to stay ahead of your competitors. This includes monitoring updates for search engine algorithms and metrics as well as new features on social media networks. If you've been doing your homework, you'll already know about two great new Ad Features on Facebook, if you haven't been, we're here for you with the cheat sheet.

Using Campaign Labels on Facebook Ads

First up is the new way to give your campaigns some more structure. Facebook recently rolled out the Campaign Label options, which is exclusive to the PE (Power Editor) so if you aren't using it already, you should start now. This is a great tool for internet marketing campaigns where you have more than one running at a time and with more than one initiative. This will help you keep all of your campaigns in order for easy reference in the future.

Simply head to your PE dashboard (in Facebook Ads Manager on the left), download your ad account and pick the ""Campaign View"" selection. Your campaign labels will be grouped together on the left-hand column in PE where you normally see ""Recent, Active, Paused and All"" categories. With the Campaign Label function, you can easily pull up successful campaigns and use the meta data to shape your new ones or access your new advertising campaigns to quickly cross-reference them.

This can be super-handy around the holiday season as you can get a better handle on your Cyber Monday ad campaigns, Black Friday ad campaigns, Christmas ad campaigns, etc. Clear up the clutter on you Facebook Ads wall today and better analyze your data for more successful Facebook Ads moving forward.

Finding Your Unpublished or Dark Page Posts on Facebook

If you don't want to publish an ad just yet to your Newsfeed, simply create them, amplify them, change, them, whatever, by keeping them dark. Officially called ""Unpublished Posts"", your dark page is also exclusive to your PE. This one takes a little while to show up so if you're new to Facebook Ads, you might need to get some more experience to access the feature (not sure why Facebook did this, but look for it to change in the near future as the Ad Features become more ingrained in everyday advertising use).

To create an Unpublished Ad, simply create the Ad, choose the Page Post as the ad type and select ""Create New Unpublished Post."" By doing this, you'll be able to do some great A/B testing with your posts, further increasing the functionality and overall usefulness of Facebook Ads. While they were once simple in nature, their complexity is making for a more streamlined targeted ad campaign, making Facebook a viable contender for the best internet marketing tool.

You can also use dark posts to geo-target your audience with specific promotions. Switch between locations, genders, age groups, etc. This helps you get a better handle on and understanding of your audience. And if you love boosting your posts, keeping them unpublished at certain times will keep your Facebook page unclouded with spammy feeling ads. This directly increases the effectiveness of your boosted post since while they are unpublished, they aren't spamming up your customer's newsfeeds and also aren't running out your paid reach budget (think of it like a pause button).

Keeping Up with the Latest Social Media Tools

The bottom line here isn't so much the tools or how to use them-you've probably dealt with similar marketing tools on other platforms. The real thing to take away here is that you should be exploring the social media tool update posts, especially around the holidays when new products and features are rolling out every day.

mQRkqg0tFP0,Finding My Voice: Mark Raines at TEDxYouth@SanDiego 2013,TEDxYouth,UC-yTB2bUcin9mmah36sXiYA,"A courageous talk by teacher Mark Raines on how losing his normal ability to speak helped him find his true voice.  By tackling his challenge with passion, grace and determination, this teacher's personal struggles and triumphs have provided the greatest lesson of all to his students.  

An award-winning television and film teacher at Canyon Crest Academy, Mark Raines, is passionate about helping students find and share their voice through film.  He was named National New Teacher of the Year by the Association for Career and Technical Education in 2008 and also received teaching recognition from the Toyota International Teacher Program, USAToday, and the Radio Shack National Teacher Award. For the past 14 years, Mark has been the executive producer of a weekly student-produced television broadcast along with hundreds of student films and videos, often showcased in the nation's largest film festivals.  

TEDxYouth@SanDiego is an independently organized TEDx event designed by youth, for youth to bring the power of big ideas to the youth of San Diego -- and the world. www.TEDxYouthSanDiego.com

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",2014-01-26T01:18:56Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQRkqg0tFP0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mQRkqg0tFP0/hqdefault.jpg,PT11M59S,8414,111,8
