- **Costco**: Does NOT carry king size Murphy beds (queen/full only)
- **IKEA**: Does NOT carry any Murphy beds
- **Wayfair**: Limited king size options available
- **Amazon**: King size options available but rare
- **Home Depot**: King size availability unclear; primarily queen size in search results

**Key Finding:** King size Murphy beds represent a niche market due to weight concerns (king mattresses are ~25% heavier than queen), safety/engineering requirements, and limited consumer demand.
