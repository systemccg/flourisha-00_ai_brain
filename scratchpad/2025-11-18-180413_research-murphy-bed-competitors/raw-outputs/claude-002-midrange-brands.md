# Mid-Range King Size Murphy Bed Brands Research
**Date:** November 18, 2025
**Research Focus:** Bestar, Murphy Bed Depot, Expand Furniture
**Target Category:** Mid-range king size Murphy bed models with specific pricing and features

---

## CRITICAL FINDING: King Size Availability Issue

A significant discovery from this research: **True king size Murphy beds are extremely rare in the mid-range segment.** Of the three brands researched:

- **Bestar**: Does NOT offer king size Murphy beds (Queen and Full only)
- **Murphy Bed Depot**: Offers king size DIY kits and components but NOT pre-assembled king models
- **Expand Furniture**: ONLY brand with complete king size Murphy bed systems available

This represents a major market gap for consumers seeking ready-to-use king size Murphy beds in the mid-range price category ($2,000-$5,000).
