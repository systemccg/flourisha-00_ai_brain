# Direct-to-Consumer King Size Murphy Bed Brands Research
## Comprehensive Competitive Analysis 2025

**Research Date:** November 18, 2025
**Scope:** King size Murphy beds available through DTC channels (Amazon, Wayfair, direct websites)
**Focus:** Specific products, pricing, customer reviews, and DTC vs. traditional retail comparison

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

King-size Murphy beds represent a niche but growing segment of the space-saving furniture market. While less common than queen and full-size options due to size and weight constraints, several direct-to-consumer manufacturers offer premium king-size models. The DTC channel has captured approximately 49% of furniture sales (as of 2020) and offers significant price advantages over traditional retail by eliminating middlemen.

**Key Finding:** Only 3-4 major DTC brands currently offer king-size Murphy beds, with Wilding Wallbeds and Murphy Bed Depot being the primary options. Limited king-size availability through Amazon and Wayfair.
