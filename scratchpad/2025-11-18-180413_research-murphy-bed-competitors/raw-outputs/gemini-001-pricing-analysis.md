## Pricing Factor Analysis

### 1. Materials (Most Significant Price Driver)

**Material Type Impact on Cost:**

| Material | Price Tier | Characteristics | Typical Cost Impact |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **MDF/Particleboard** | Budget | Basic, less durable | $1,500-$2,500 |
| **Engineered Wood/Plywood** | Mid-Range | Decent durability, poplar options | $2,500-$4,000 |

| **Italian Hardwoods + Premium Finishes** | Luxury | Rare woods, custom finishes, leather | $7,000-$18,000+ |

**Key Material Considerations:**
- Solid wood construction provides 15-20 year lifespan vs 8-10 years for engineered wood
- Lori Beds uses ethically-sourced Spanish poplar as cost-effective option
- Premium brands (Clei, Milano) emphasize sustainable sourcing and premium finishes
- Leather, veneer, and specialty finishes add $300-$1,500 to base cost

### 2. Lifting Mechanism (Critical Functionality Factor)

**Mechanism Types and Cost Impact:**

| Mechanism Type | Cost Level | Performance | Typical Use |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Manual Spring-Lift** | Budget | Requires adjustment over time, lighter operation | Budget segment |
| **Spring Piston Hybrid** | Mid-Range | Better balance, smoother operation | Mid-range models |
| **Gas Piston Assist** | Premium | Nearly silent, smooth, minimal maintenance | Premium segment |

- Piston-lift systems: Add $800-$1,500 to base cost
- Motorized/Electric systems: Add $2,000-$4,000 to base cost
- Smart home integration: Add $500-$1,000

**Market Observation:** Higher-end manufacturers (Wilding, Clei) use piston systems as standard; budget brands rely on springs for cost control.

### 3. Customization & Features

**Major Add-On Costs:**

| Feature | Cost Impact | Typical Add-On Price |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Built-in Desk** | Medium | $400-$800 |

### 4. Size & Load-Bearing Requirements

**King Size Premium Analysis:**
- King-size beds require reinforced mechanisms to support 280-320 lb loads
- Larger cabinet dimensions require more material
- More complex piston arrangements needed
- King-size availability is limited—not all manufacturers offer this size
- Estimated premium: 20-40% above queen-size equivalent

**Market Reality:** Some manufacturers (notably budget brands) don't offer king-size options due to mechanical complexity.

### 5. Design & Manufacturing Origin

**Manufacturing Impact on Pricing:**

| Origin/Design | Price Position | Market Examples |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Domestic DIY Kits** | Budget | NextBed, Murphy Bed Hardware |
| **North American Mass-Produced** | Mid-Range | Lori Beds, BredaBeds, Wilding |

**Geographic Price Factors:**
- Italian brands (Clei, LGM) command 40-60% premiums due to craftsmanship, design, and import costs
