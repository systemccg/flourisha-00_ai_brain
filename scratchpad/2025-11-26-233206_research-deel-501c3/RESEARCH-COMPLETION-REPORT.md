## Key Discoveries

### 1. Complete 50-State Coverage
No state exclusions found. Deel supports tax compliance in all 50 states, from no-income-tax states (TX, FL, AK, NV, TN, WA, WY) to high-tax states (CA, MA, NY).

### 2. Multi-State Complexity Management
Deel addresses the most complex payroll tax scenario: employees working across multiple states. The platform automatically handles work-location-based tax withholding, which is the IRS standard (not employee residence or employer location).

### 3. Automated End-to-End Compliance
The platform provides complete automation from:
- Federal tax calculation → IRS filing (Forms 941, 940)
- State tax withholding → State agency filing
- Employee documents → W-2/1099 generation and distribution
- Accounting integration → Real-time sync with accounting software

### 4. Liability Assumption
When acting as EOR (Employer of Record), Deel assumes full employer liability for payroll tax compliance, providing significant risk mitigation for growing companies and nonprofits.

### 5. Expert Support Available
350+ in-house payroll and legal professionals provide guidance, making Deel more than just a platform—it's backed by human expertise for complex scenarios.

2. **IRS Official Guidance** - Tax rates, form requirements, deadlines
3. **Authoritative Tax Experts** - CPA firms, payroll compliance specialists
4. **Payroll Industry Standards** - Multi-state payroll guides, best practices

### Search Queries Executed (6 parallel queries)

6. Limitations and gaps in compliance coverage

### Verification Approach

- Compared Deel capabilities against industry standards
- Validated 2025 tax rates and forms
- Identified limitations and boundary conditions

---

## Limitations Identified

1. **US-Only for Payroll Plan** - Deel's US Payroll service covers only US employees/contractors; international payroll requires separate EOR solution

2. **State-Dependent Benefits** - Some benefit offerings vary based on state/local regulations

3. **Multi-Entity Filing** - Requires separate filing submission for each business entity

4. **Pre-Setup Requirements** - Some features (e.g., new state registrations) may require pre-filing approval or additional setup

---

## Recommendations for 501(c)(3) Organizations

Based on this research, nonprofits using Deel should:

1. **Ensure Proper Payroll Tax Filings** - Tax-exempt status doesn't eliminate payroll tax obligations; Deel's automation ensures compliance with all federal and state requirements

2. **Maintain Form 990 Integration** - Payroll records must integrate with annual Form 990 filing requirements, especially for highly compensated employee reporting

3. **Leverage Multi-State Support** - If operating across states or employing remote workers, Deel's multi-state capabilities significantly reduce compliance burden

4. **Document Classification** - Carefully classify employees vs. contractors; Deel provides guidance but documentation of classification basis is essential

5. **Use Compliance Monitoring** - Activate Deel's compliance alerts to stay current with changing state and federal requirements affecting nonprofits
