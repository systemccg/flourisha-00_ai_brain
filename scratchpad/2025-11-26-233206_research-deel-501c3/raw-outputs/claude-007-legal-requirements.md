# Legal Requirements for US 501c3 Nonprofits to Employ Workers in Colombia

**Research Date:** November 26, 2025
**Subject:** Employment, registration, tax, and compliance requirements for US 501c3 organizations hiring workers in Colombia
**Scope:** Legal entity requirements, Colombian registration, tax obligations, EOR alternatives, and compliance framework

---

## Executive Summary

A US 501c3 nonprofit organization cannot directly hire Colombian employees without establishing a legal presence in the country. The organization must either:

1. **Establish a local legal entity** (subsidiary, branch, or nonprofit registration) in Colombia
2. **Use an Employer of Record (EOR)** service to handle employment on their behalf

Both approaches require compliance with Colombian labor law, tax registration, social security contributions, and ongoing compliance with Colombian authorities. Additionally, the 501c3 organization must maintain compliance with US IRS regulations regarding foreign operations and ensure proper oversight of international activities.

---

## Part 1: US 501c3 Compliance Requirements for Foreign Operations

### 1.1 General International Operation Requirements

US 501c3 nonprofits have the legal right to operate internationally and conduct charitable activities abroad. However, organizations must carefully navigate multiple regulatory frameworks:

**Key Requirements:**

- **Charitable Purpose Compliance:** All international activities must further the organization's stated exempt purpose and be consistent with 501c3 status requirements
- **OFAC Compliance:** Organizations must screen all individuals and entities they work with against the OFAC Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List to ensure they are not conducting transactions with prohibited parties
- **Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA):** Organizations must not make payments to foreign government officials and must avoid facilitating corruption
- **Tax Law Compliance:** US tax laws governing 501c3 organizations (restrictions on lobbying, political activities, intermediate sanctions, and Unrelated Business Income Tax rules) apply globally

### 1.2 Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR)

US 501c3 organizations operating in Colombia with foreign bank accounts must comply with FBAR requirements:

- **Reporting Threshold:** Foreign financial accounts exceeding $10,000 in aggregate must be reported
- **Filing Form:** Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR)
- **Penalties for Non-Compliance:**
  - Non-willful violations: Up to $10,000 per account per year
  - Willful violations: Up to 50% of the account value or $100,000, whichever is greater

### 1.3 Grant-Making and Fund Distribution

If the 501c3 is providing grants or transferring funds to Colombian organizations or individuals:

- **Discretion and Control:** The nonprofit must retain "discretion and control" over how funds are used to ensure they serve approved charitable purposes
- **Grant Agreements:** Formal grant agreements should be in place documenting the intended use and oversight mechanisms
- **Documentation:** Maintain detailed records of how international funds are used and ensure they support the organization's exempt purpose

### 1.4 Foreign Organization Scrutiny

Colombian partners or subsidiary organizations should be vetted for:

- Alignment with the 501c3's charitable mission
- Compliance with Colombian law
- Absence of prohibited activities
- Proper financial governance and reporting mechanisms

---

## Part 2: Legal Entity Requirements in Colombia

### 2.1 Direct Employment Restrictions

**Critical Requirement:** Foreign companies cannot directly hire Colombian employees without a legal entity in Colombia.

Foreign organizations seeking to employ Colombian workers must establish one of the following:

1. **Colombian Subsidiary** (most common: SAS - Sociedad por Acciones Simplificada)
2. **Foreign Branch Office** (sucursal)
3. **Registered Foreign Nonprofit Organization**

### 2.2 Colombian Subsidiary Formation (SAS)

For nonprofit organizations or entities seeking to establish long-term operations, a SAS (Sociedad por Acciones Simplificada) is a flexible business entity option:

**Advantages:**
- Single shareholder ownership permitted
- No minimum capital requirement
- Capital can be paid over up to 2 years
- Limited liability protection
- Flexible corporate governance structure
- Faster formation timeline

**Formation Timeline:** 2-4 weeks for basic registration; 4-6 weeks for complete incorporation including:
- Bylaws drafting
- Chamber of Commerce registration
- Tax registration (DIAN)
- Corporate bank account setup

**Key Steps:**
1. Draft corporate bylaws
2. Register with Chamber of Commerce (Cámara de Comercio)
3. Obtain Tax ID (NIT - Número de Identificación Tributaria) from DIAN
4. Register foreign investment with Banco de la República
5. Open corporate bank account

**Foreign Investor Considerations:**
- Remote formation is possible using apostilled Power of Attorney
- Forming a company does not require a visa
- Managers/operators may need appropriate visa (Investor, Business Owner, or Resident visa)
- Foreign investment registration protects profit repatriation rights

### 2.3 Foreign Branch Office (Sucursal)

An alternative structure for foreign organizations:

**Characteristics:**
- Permanent legal presence in Colombia
- Scope of operations defined by parent company
- Requires at least one Colombian permanent resident as legal representative
- Less separate liability than subsidiary

**When Appropriate:** Organizations maintaining closer control over Colombian operations or testing the market

### 2.4 Registered Foreign Nonprofit Organization

For organizations specifically operating as nonprofits in Colombia:

**Registration Authority:** Chamber of Commerce of Bogotá (CCB)

**Government Approval Process:**
- Referral from Ministry of the Interior (required)
- Regulation under Decree 019 of 2012
- Oversight by Superintendence of Industry and Commerce (Circulars 008 and 012 of 2012)

**Registration Requirements:**
- Appoint attorney-in-fact(s) with legal representation powers
- Execute legalized public deed(s) granting powers to Colombian representatives
- Register appointment with CCB
- Establish main domicile/operating location in Colombia

**Registered Procedures:**
- Initial registration of foreign nonprofit certificate
- Appointment/modification of attorney-in-fact powers (via notarized public deed)
- Modification of main operating domicile (via notarized public deed)
- Cancellation or revocation of attorney-in-fact designation

**Tax ID (NIT - Número de Identificación Tributaria):**
- Required for all entities operating in Colombia
- Obtained through registration in RUT (Unified Tax Registry)
- Essential for invoicing, bank accounts, and tax compliance
- All foreign nationals require a NIT for tax matters

**Unified Tax Registry (RUT):** All employers must be registered with DIAN

### 3.2 Employer Withholding Tax on Salaries

#### For Resident Employees:
- Employers must calculate and withhold income tax monthly from employee salaries
- Withholding is based on a progressive scale relative to the employee's income level

#### For Non-Resident Employees (Foreign Workers):
- Withholding rate: **20% of total monthly compensation**
- Applies to foreign nationals who are non-tax residents in Colombia
- Must be withheld and deposited with DIAN monthly

### 3.3 Industry and Commerce Tax (ICA)

**Municipal Tax on Gross Income:**
- **Rate Range:** 0.2% to 1.0% of gross income (municipality-dependent)
- **Application:** Each municipality sets its own rate and payment schedule
- **Calculation:** Based on gross revenue regardless of profitability
- **Filing:** Monthly or quarterly depending on municipality and business classification

**Important:** ICA is in addition to national income tax obligations

### 3.4 Withholding Tax on Payments to Non-Residents

If the 501c3 or its Colombian entity makes payments to foreign (non-resident) individuals or entities:

- **Standard rates:**
  - Service fees/technical assistance: 20%
  - Royalties: 20%
  - Interest: 20%
  - Dividends to non-residents: 20% (35% + 20% if from untaxed profits)

- **Double Taxation Treaty Relief:** If the 501c3 or foreign payments recipient is from a treaty partner country, reduced rates may apply
  - Requires Certificate of Tax Residence from the foreign entity's tax authority
  - Colombia has entered treaties with multiple countries

### 3.5 Withholding Tax Compliance and Filing

**Withholding Agent Obligations:**
- Collect applicable withholding taxes
- Deposit withheld amounts with DIAN

- **Applies to:** Sale of goods and services
- **Registration:** Entities with gross income exceeding certain thresholds must be registered as IVA taxpayers
- **Compliance:** Monthly or quarterly filing depending on sales volume

---

## Part 4: Social Security Contributions and Payroll Obligations

### 4.1 Mandatory Enrollment Requirements

All employers hiring employees in Colombia must enroll workers in:

1. **Health Insurance (EPS):** Employer contributes typically 8-9% of salary
2. **Pension Fund (AFP):** Employer contributes typically 12% of salary
3. **Occupational Risk Insurance (ARL):** Rate varies by industry risk classification

- **Compliance:** All workforce composition must be documented and reported

---

## Part 5: Alternative Approach - Employer of Record (EOR)

For organizations that cannot or prefer not to establish a Colombian legal entity, an Employer of Record (EOR) service offers a viable alternative.

### 5.1 What is an EOR?

An Employer of Record is a third-party service provider that becomes the legal employer of your workers in Colombia. The EOR:

- Serves as the official employer on contracts and records
- Assumes all employment-related liabilities and compliance obligations
- Handles all payroll, tax, and social security functions
- Allows the nonprofit to hire and manage workers without establishing a local entity

### 5.2 Advantages of EOR vs. Direct Entity Establishment

| Factor | EOR | Direct Legal Entity |
|--------|-----|-------------------|
| **Timeline** | Days to weeks | 4-6 weeks minimum |
| **Complexity** | Low - EOR handles compliance | High - Must manage Colombian regulations |
| **Upfront Cost** | Lower monthly fees | Higher initial setup costs |
| **Ongoing Admin** | Minimal | Significant compliance burden |
| **Risk** | EOR assumes employment liability | Organization assumes liability |
| **Control** | Moderate (you manage workers, EOR handles compliance) | Full control and responsibility |
| **Long-term Viability** | Good for temporary/test market | Better for long-term establishment |

### 5.3 What an EOR Handles

- **Payroll Processing:** Monthly calculation, withholding, and payment
- **Tax Compliance:** ICA, income tax withholding, documentation
- **Social Security:** Enrollment and monthly contributions through PILA
- **Employment Contracts:** Preparation and execution per Colombian law
- **Compliance:** Ensuring adherence to Colombian labor laws
- **Reporting:** Form 350, social security filings, and required documentation
- **Liability:** Legal responsibility for employment-related issues

### 5.4 EOR Fees and Costs

- Typically charged as a percentage of payroll (varies by provider)
- May include per-employee setup fees
- Usually more cost-effective than full entity establishment for small teams
- Pricing varies by EOR provider and complexity of operations

### 5.5 When to Choose EOR

**EOR is appropriate when:**
- Testing the Colombian market before full commitment
- Hiring small teams (1-10 employees)
- Need rapid deployment (hiring timeline measured in days/weeks)
- Want to avoid compliance complexity and liability
- Long-term Colombian presence is uncertain
- Budget constraints prohibit entity establishment

### 5.6 When to Establish Direct Entity

**Establish a Colombian entity when:**
- Hiring 10+ employees or planning significant growth
- Long-term strategic commitment to Colombia
- Need full operational control and governance authority
- Cost-benefit analysis favors permanent infrastructure
- Building a subsidiary or branch office network

Before hiring Colombian workers (via entity or EOR):

1. **OFAC Screening:** Verify workers are not on OFAC SDN List
2. **Work Authorization:** Confirm workers have appropriate legal status

## Conclusion

Employing workers in Colombia as a US 501c3 nonprofit requires careful navigation of both US and Colombian legal frameworks. The organization has two primary pathways:

1. **Employer of Record (EOR):** Optimal for small teams, rapid deployment, and market testing
2. **Direct Legal Entity:** Optimal for large teams, long-term commitment, and operational control

Regardless of the approach selected, the organization must:

- Maintain 501c3 compliance and US tax law adherence
- Register with Colombian tax authorities and obtain NIT
- Comply with Colombian labor and employment law
- Fulfill social security contribution obligations
- Conduct OFAC and FCPA screening
- Maintain board oversight of international operations
- Engage both US nonprofit and Colombian legal counsel

Early engagement with qualified legal and tax advisors in both jurisdictions is strongly recommended to ensure proper setup and ongoing compliance.
