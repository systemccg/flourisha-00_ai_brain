## Cost Scenarios for 4-Employee Setup

### Scenario 1: Using Deel Global Payroll (Own Entity in Colombia)

**Assumption:** Organization has or will create legal entities in both the US and Colombia.

**Monthly Costs:**
- 2 US Employees: 2 × $19 = **$38**
- 2 Colombia Employees: 2 × $29 = **$58**
- **Monthly Subtotal:** $96

**One-Time Costs:**
- Entity Setup Fee (Colombia): **$1,000 USD** (one-time implementation fee per entity)

- One-Time Setup: $1,000
- **Year 1 Total: $2,152**

**Annual Projection (Year 2+):**
- Recurring Monthly: $96 × 12 = **$1,152/year**

**With Annual Billing Discount (20% savings):**
- Year 1: $2,152 - ($1,152 × 0.20) = **$1,918.40**
- Year 2+: $1,152 × 0.80 = **$921.60/year**

---

### Scenario 2: Using Deel EOR for Colombia + US Payroll (No Colombia Entity)

**Monthly Costs:**
- 2 US Employees: 2 × $19 = **$38**

- With 20% discount: **$11,865.60/year**

---

## Important Considerations

3. **Implementation Timeline:** One-time setup fees suggest implementation process; timeline varies by region but typically 1-3 weeks.

### Operational Considerations
1. **Currency & Payment Methods:** International payments may incur conversion fees depending on withdrawal/transfer method selected.

2. **Integration Requirements:** Deel integrates with major HRIS and accounting platforms; custom integrations may require additional fees.

3. **Support Tiers:** Standard support included; premium support may have additional costs.

### Data & Compliance
1. **Data Security:** Ensure compliance with Colombian data protection laws and company privacy policies.

2. **Reporting Requirements:** Standard reports included; custom reporting may incur additional fees.
