# Deel vs. Traditional PEO: Comprehensive Comparison for US Employees

**Research Date:** November 26, 2025
**Focus Areas:** Model comparison, features, pricing, pros/cons, use cases

---

## Executive Summary

Deel offers both a traditional **US PEO model** ($79-$95/employee/month) and a **lightweight US Payroll alternative** ($19/employee/month), positioning itself as a more modern, globally-integrated alternative to legacy PEO services. Traditional PEOs like ADP TotalSource, Paychex, and Insperity charge $100-$250/employee/month and focus primarily on domestic operations.

## Part 1: Understanding the Models

### Traditional PEO Model

A **Professional Employer Organization (PEO)** is a full-service HR outsourcing solution based on **co-employment**:

#### How Traditional PEOs Work
- **Co-Employment Relationship:** The PEO becomes the statutory employer for tax purposes and shares employer responsibilities with the client company
- **Employer of Record:** The PEO files payroll taxes under its own tax identification number (EIN)
- **Shared Liability:** Legal and compliance responsibilities are shared between the PEO and the client company
- **Full-Service HR:** The PEO handles all HR administration, payroll, benefits, compliance, and risk management

#### Traditional PEO Services Included
1. **Payroll Administration**
   - Paycheck processing
   - Tax withholding and calculations
   - Wage garnishment handling

2. **Benefits Administration**
   - Health insurance negotiation
   - Workers' compensation insurance
   - General liability insurance
   - Employment practices liability insurance
   - Retirement plans (401k, etc.)

3. **Tax Compliance & Filing**
   - Federal, state, and local payroll taxes
   - Unemployment insurance taxes
   - Workers' compensation coverage
   - Automatic tax filing with PEO's EIN

4. **HR Management & Compliance**
   - Employee handbook development
   - Policy creation and updates
   - Employee classification guidance
   - Compliance with federal and state labor laws
   - HR consulting support

5. **Risk Management**
   - Employment practices liability mitigation
   - Compliance oversight across all 50 states
   - Legal protection through shared liability

### Deel's Model: Dual Approach

Deel uniquely offers **two distinct options** for US employees:

#### Option 1: Deel US Payroll (Payroll Service Provider)
- **NOT co-employment**: Deel is a payroll processor, not an employer
- **What Deel handles:** Payroll processing, tax calculations, contractor management
- **What the client handles:** Legal liability, HR management, compliance responsibility
- **Similar to:** Traditional payroll service providers (not true PEOs)
- **Price:** $19-$59/employee/month

#### Option 2: Deel US PEO (Co-Employment Model)
- **IS co-employment**: Deel becomes a statutory employer
- **What Deel handles:** Full HR, payroll, benefits, compliance, tax filing
- **What the client handles:** Day-to-day management and organizational decisions
- **Similar to:** Traditional PEOs
- **Price:** $79-$95/employee/month
