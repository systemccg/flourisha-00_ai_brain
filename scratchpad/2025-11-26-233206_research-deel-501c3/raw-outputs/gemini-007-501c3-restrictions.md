# Research Report: IRS and DOL Restrictions on 501c3 Organizations Using Deel

**Date:** November 26, 2025
**Research Focus:** IRS regulations, Department of Labor compliance, and nonprofit-specific employment rules for using Deel's services

---

## Executive Summary

This research examines whether IRS and Department of Labor impose specific restrictions on 501c3 organizations using third-party HR platforms like Deel. The findings indicate that **no explicit prohibition exists** against 501c3 organizations using Deel or similar platforms. However, 501c3 organizations must adhere to several compliance requirements that apply regardless of which payroll service provider they use.

**Key Finding:** The responsibility for compliance ultimately rests with the nonprofit organization, not the service provider, even when using third-party solutions like Deel.

---

## I. IRS Regulations for 501c3 Employers

### A. Third-Party Payroll Service Provider Requirements

**IRS Position on Outsourcing:**
- The IRS explicitly allows nonprofit organizations to partner with HR and payroll solutions for payroll processing
- Organizations may outsource payroll duties to third-party payroll service providers (PSP) to ensure compliance with IRS filing and deposit requirements
- **Critical Principle:** Even when using third-party providers, the employer organization **remains ultimately responsible** for:
  - Federal income tax withholding
  - Social Security and Medicare tax compliance
  - Timely filing of tax returns
  - Accurate payment of withheld amounts

**Trust Fund Recovery Penalty Risk:**
- The Trust Fund Recovery Penalty may be assessed against any person (officer, director, employee, or board member) who is responsible for collecting or paying withheld taxes and willfully fails to do so
- This applies to 501c3 organizations regardless of whether they use a payroll service provider
- **Note:** Using a third-party provider does NOT transfer this liability

### B. Employment Tax Obligations for Tax-Exempt Organizations

**Nonprofit Tax Obligations:**
If a 501c3 organization has employees, it must:
- Withhold federal income tax from employee wages
- Pay both the employer and employee portions of Social Security and Medicare taxes (FICA)
- Withhold and pay federal unemployment taxes (FUTA) if applicable
- Exception: Employers may skip FICA on wages under $100/calendar year for any single employee

**Employment Taxes Apply Regardless of Exemption Status:**
- Tax-exempt status does NOT exempt the organization from employment tax obligations
- All payroll taxes must be withheld and paid according to standard employer requirements

**Source:** [IRS - Employment Taxes for Exempt Organizations](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/employment-taxes-for-exempt-organizations)

### C. Section 4958 - Excess Benefit Transactions

**Definition:**
An "excess benefit transaction" occurs when an applicable tax-exempt organization provides economic benefits to a disqualified person (officer, director, key employee) that exceed the value of goods or services provided in return.

**Critical Restriction for Compensation:**
- Compensation must be "reasonable" for the services rendered
- Reasonable compensation is determined by considering:
  - Industry standards
  - Comparable positions at similar organizations
  - Job responsibilities and complexity
  - Geographic location and cost of living
  - Individual qualifications and experience

**Penalties for Violation:**
- **Initial Tax:** 25% excise tax on the excess benefit amount paid to the disqualified person
- **Additional Tax:** 200% excise tax if the violation is not corrected within the applicable time period
- **Manager Tax:** 10% excise tax on organization managers who participated knowingly in the excess benefit transaction (maximum $20,000 per transaction)

**Rebuttable Presumption of Reasonableness:**
Organizations can protect themselves by following specific procedures for compensation decisions:
- Obtaining and reviewing comparable salary data
- Approving compensation through a process that includes individuals without conflicts of interest
- Documenting the decision-making process

**Important Note:** While Deel can assist with payroll administration, it cannot make compensation reasonableness determinations for your organization. The 501c3 itself must ensure compensation complies with Section 4958.

### D. Private Inurement Doctrine

**Fundamental Prohibition:**
The IRC 501(c)(3) requirement states that "no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual."

**How It Relates to Employment:**
- Compensation to employees, officers, and directors must not constitute "hidden distributions of profits"
- Even minimal or incidental private inurement can jeopardize tax-exempt status
- Compensation must be reasonable and arms-length

**Distinction from Excess Benefit:**
- Private inurement is an absolute prohibition (even small amounts violate it)
- Excess benefit transactions are subject to intermediate sanctions (penalties) rather than loss of exemption
- Both restrictions apply to how nonprofits compensate employees

**Compliance Best Practices:**
- Use compensation committees with board members not serving as officers
- Compare compensation to industry surveys and benchmarks
- Document the rationale for compensation decisions
- Ensure compensation reflects market rates

**Source:** [IRS - Inurement/Private Benefit: Charitable Organizations](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/inurement-private-benefit-charitable-organizations)

### E. Form 990 Reporting Requirements

**Compensation Disclosure:**
- Nonprofits must report compensation information for certain employees on their Form 990
- Schedule J (Compensation Information) requires reporting for:
  - Officers, directors, and trustees
  - Key employees
  - Highly compensated employees

**What Must Be Reported:**
- Reportable compensation (from W-2 Box 5)
- Other compensation (amounts not on W-2 or 1099)
- Only specific compensation types under $10,000 may be omitted

**Payroll Service Provider Implications:**
- Form 990 must reflect actual compensation paid, regardless of how it's processed
- Organizations using Deel must ensure accurate compensation data is reported on Form 990
- The IRS may scrutinize compensation reporting for reasonableness

**Important Note:** Deel can provide compensation data for Form 990 reporting, but the nonprofit remains responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the filing.

## II. Department of Labor Compliance

### A. Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) - Applicability to Nonprofits

**General Rule - No FLSA Coverage for Charitable Activities:**
- Nonprofit organizations are **generally NOT covered** by FLSA requirements when they engage in charitable activities
- Volunteers may work for nonprofits without FLSA protections if they:
  - Volunteer "freely" without compensation
  - Are not performing the same work they're employed to do
  - Are not working in commercial activities

**Enterprise Coverage Exception:**
A nonprofit IS subject to FLSA if it meets the enterprise coverage threshold:
- Annual gross receipts of at least **$500,000** from ordinary commercial activities (e.g., gift shops, fee-based services)
- "Contributions, membership fees, dues, and donations" do NOT count toward this threshold
- Only business activities count

**Individual Coverage Exception:**
Even nonprofits below the $500,000 threshold may have FLSA-covered employees if those employees are:
- Engaged in interstate commerce
- Producing goods for interstate commerce
- Working in closely-related processes directly essential to interstate commerce production

**Implication for Deel Usage:**
Using Deel does not change FLSA applicability. If your nonprofit would otherwise be covered by FLSA, using Deel doesn't exempt you. If you wouldn't normally be covered, Deel doesn't create coverage.

**Source:** [DOL Fact Sheet #14A - Non-Profit Organizations and the Fair Labor Standards Act](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/14a-flsa-non-profits)

### B. Wage and Hour Compliance

**Minimum Wage Requirements:**
- Where FLSA applies, nonprofits must pay at least the federal minimum wage ($7.25/hour as of 2025, or applicable state minimum)
- State minimum wage laws may impose stricter requirements than FLSA
- Using a third-party payroll processor doesn't exempt organizations from these requirements

**Overtime Requirements:**
- Where FLSA applies, nonprofits must pay overtime (1.5x regular rate) for hours over 40/week
- Deel's platform can help track and ensure overtime compliance, but the nonprofit remains legally responsible
- Some states have stricter overtime requirements than federal FLSA

**Record-Keeping:**
- Nonprofits covered by FLSA must maintain accurate time and wage records
- Deel can facilitate this through its timekeeping and payroll system
- The nonprofit retains ultimate responsibility for record accuracy

**Third-Party Arrangements:**
- Third-party employment relationships (like using an EOR service) can affect FLSA coverage determinations
- However, the underlying principles of wage and hour compliance still apply

**Source:** [DOL - Handy Reference Guide to the Fair Labor Standards Act](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/compliance-assistance/handy-reference-guide-flsa)

### C. Worker Classification

**Critical Compliance Area:**
Misclassification of workers (employee vs. independent contractor) can result in:
- IRS enforcement actions
- State Department of Labor penalties
- Back-tax and wage liability claims
- Penalties for willful misclassification

**Nonprofit Requirements:**
- Must properly classify all workers as either employees or independent contractors
- Classification based on actual working relationship, not labels or agreements
- IRS Form W-2 vs. 1099 reflects correct worker classification

**Deel's Role:**
- Deel can facilitate payroll for classified employees
- Deel also offers contract management tools for independent contractors
- The nonprofit must determine the correct classification; Deel implements it
- Using Deel does not create a safe harbor for misclassification

**Source:** [DOL - Worker Misclassification Overview](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/compliance-assistance/worker-misclassification)

### D. Anti-Discrimination and Equal Employment Law

**Nonprofits Are Subject to:**
- Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (race, color, religion, sex, national origin)
- Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
- Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)
- Equal Pay Act

**Nonprofit Status Does Not Provide Exceptions:**
- All anti-discrimination laws apply equally to nonprofits and for-profits
- Small nonprofit exemptions for some laws may apply (e.g., Title VII may exempt organizations with fewer than 15 employees)
- Deel cannot override or exempt organizations from anti-discrimination requirements

**Third-Party Service Provider Role:**
- Deel can assist with compliance documentation and reporting
- The nonprofit retains responsibility for ensuring non-discriminatory practices
- Using Deel does not transfer anti-discrimination obligations

---

## III. Nonprofit-Specific Employment Rules

### A. Volunteer vs. Employee Distinction

**When Someone is an Employee:**
- Receives compensation (wages, salary, stipend)
- Subject to IRS withholding
- Entitled to employment law protections
- Must be reported on payroll

**When Someone is a Volunteer:**
- Provides services without compensation or expectation of compensation
- Not subject to payroll taxes
- Limited employment law protections
- May volunteer for nonprofits without FLSA coverage

**Critical Restriction:**
- An individual cannot be both an employee and volunteer for the same organization doing the same work
- Cannot "volunteer" to do work you're already paid to do
- Mixing employee and volunteer status for same tasks can trigger wage and hour violations

**Deel's Application:**
- Deel is designed for employee payroll
- Deel is not appropriate for volunteer management
- Nonprofits must separately track and manage volunteers outside of Deel
- Using Deel for true volunteers would create tax compliance problems

### B. Reasonable Compensation and Section 4958

**Why This Matters:**
- Compensation is the most common source of IRS scrutiny for nonprofits
- Excessive compensation jeopardizes tax-exempt status
- Section 4958 penalties can be substantial

**Benchmarking Requirements:**
- Use published salary surveys (e.g., GuideStar, Mercer, PayScale)
- Compare to similar organizations of similar size
- Consider geographic differences
- Account for job complexity and responsibilities

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Board resolution approving compensation
- Comparative salary data considered
- Minutes showing compensation decision process
- Signed conflict-of-interest disclosures

**Deel's Limitations:**
- Deel can administer compensation but not approve it
- Deel cannot determine "reasonableness"
- Nonprofit must independently verify compensation is reasonable
- Using Deel does not satisfy Section 4958 requirements

**Source:** [IRS - Intermediate Sanctions - Excess Benefit Transactions](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/intermediate-sanctions-excess-benefit-transactions)

### C. International Hiring Restrictions

**Nonprofits Have No Special Exemptions:**
- 501c3 status provides no exception to international employment law
- Nonprofits hiring internationally must comply with local laws in each country
- Same restrictions apply to nonprofits as to for-profit companies

**Country-Specific Restrictions:**
Example: Philippines requires expat employees to have skills/talents not available locally
Example: France requires employment contracts in French and complying with French labor law

**Deel's Global Platform:**
- Deel operates in 150+ countries
- Deel helps nonprofits navigate local compliance requirements
- However, Deel cannot override local hiring restrictions
- Some countries may prohibit nonprofit hiring of foreign nationals in certain roles

**Documentation and Compliance:**
- Nonprofits must comply with visa requirements
- Must meet local hiring preferences
- Must follow local employment contract requirements
- Must comply with local tax and payroll regulations

## V. Key Findings and Conclusions

### Finding #1: No Explicit IRS or DOL Restriction Against Using Deel

**Conclusion:** There is no IRS regulation or Department of Labor rule that explicitly prohibits 501c3 organizations from using Deel's services. In fact:
- The IRS explicitly allows nonprofits to use third-party payroll service providers
- The DOL does not restrict nonprofits from using third-party HR platforms
- Using Deel does not create any automatic exemptions or additional restrictions

### Finding #2: Responsibility Remains with the Nonprofit

**Conclusion:** Regardless of using Deel or any other payroll provider:
- The nonprofit organization retains ultimate responsibility for all compliance
- The IRS holds the organization (not Deel) liable for tax violations
- Using a third-party provider does NOT transfer legal liability
- The organization must independently verify all compliance, not rely on Deel

### Finding #3: Compensation Requirements Are Strictest Area of Concern

**Conclusion:** The most restrictive rules for nonprofits are related to employee compensation:
- IRS Section 4958 requires "reasonable" compensation

- Deel can administer compensation but cannot determine reasonableness
- Organizations must independently conduct compensation benchmarking
- Violations carry significant penalties (25%-200% excise tax)

### Finding #4: FLSA Compliance Depends on Organization Type and Activities

**Conclusion:** FLSA coverage for nonprofits is not automatic:
- Most charitable nonprofits are NOT covered by FLSA
- Nonprofits with $500K+ in commercial activities ARE covered
- Deel cannot determine FLSA coverage; the nonprofit must analyze its own activities
- If covered, all FLSA requirements apply regardless of using Deel

### Finding #5: International Hiring Requires Local Compliance

**Conclusion:** Using Deel internationally does not exempt nonprofits from local requirements:
- Each country has specific hiring restrictions and requirements
- Nonprofits have no exemptions based on tax-exempt status
- Deel helps with local compliance but cannot override restrictions
- Organizations must verify compliance with each country's laws

### Finding #6: Deel's Services Are Nonprofit-Friendly But Not Legally Comprehensive

**Conclusion:** Deel offers useful tools for nonprofits but has limitations:
- Deel automates payroll, withholding, and tax compliance
- Deel updates compensation and regulatory changes
- Deel provides global compliance in 150+ countries
- However, Deel cannot provide legal advice or make compliance decisions
