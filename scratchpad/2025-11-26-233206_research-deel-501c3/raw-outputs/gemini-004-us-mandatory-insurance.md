# Deel US Mandatory Benefits Administration Research Report

**Date:** November 26, 2025
**Research Focus:** Deel's Capabilities for Managing US Mandatory Benefits
**Report Type:** Comprehensive Benefits Administration Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

Deel provides comprehensive payroll and benefits administration services for US employers, with varying levels of support for mandatory benefits depending on the service tier (US Payroll, PEO, or Benefits Admin). While Deel handles core mandatory benefits like payroll tax withholding (Social Security, Medicare, FUTA, SUTA), workers' compensation administration, and unemployment insurance, there are significant limitations in certain states and benefit categories that employers must be aware of.

**Key Finding:** Deel is positioned as a **global payroll and international benefits solution with US capabilities**, rather than a US-first payroll provider like ADP or Gusto. This distinction creates both strengths (global team management) and limitations (US-specific benefits gaps).

---

## 1. Workers' Compensation Insurance

### Deel's Coverage and Administration

**What Deel Provides:**
- Partners with **AHT Insurance brokers** to provide workers' compensation coverage
- Offers streamlined administration of workers' compensation insurance
- Provides flexible and scalable solutions for WC management
- Maintains a team of legal experts to ensure compliance

**Estimated Employer Cost:**
- 0.25%-0.30% of payroll (varies by state and industry)

**Coverage in Standard States:**
- Deel administers and pays workers' compensation premiums
- Files claims on client's behalf
- Handles all policy administration through insurance partnerships

### Critical Limitation: Monopolistic States

In **four U.S. states** where workers' compensation insurance is only available through state-run programs (monopolistic states), Deel does NOT administer or manage coverage:

**Affected States:**
- Ohio
- North Dakota
- Washington
- Wyoming

**Employer Responsibility in Monopolistic States:**
- Deel can help explain coverage expectations
- Deel points clients to correct state portals
- **Employers must purchase coverage directly from the state**
- Deel does NOT file claims or manage state program interactions

**Impact:** Any organization with employees in these four states must independently manage workers' compensation coverage through state programs while using Deel for other 46 states and DC.

---

## 2. Unemployment Insurance (UI)

### Coverage Scope

**What Deel Handles:**
- Unemployment insurance tax calculation and withholding
- State-specific UI tax rates and requirements
- UI tax payments to state agencies
- Compliance with state UI regulations

**State-Specific Administration:**
Deel manages UI compliance through its payroll platform with state-specific configurations. Example from Minnesota:
- UI tax rates range: 0.4% - 8.9% (2025)
- Taxable wage base: $43,000
- Deel calculates based on employer's experience rating and state requirements

**Employer Record-Keeping:**
HR and financial teams remain responsible for:
- Maintaining employment records and verification requests
- Responding to state UI audit inquiries
- Managing UI benefit claims and appeals

### Services Included

**Deel US Payroll and PEO Services:**
- Automatic UI tax calculation
- Quarterly UI tax payments to state agencies
- Compliance tracking across multiple states
- Integration with accounting software

**Limitations:**
- Deel does not handle individual employee unemployment benefit claims
- Employers must respond directly to state UI agencies for employee claims
- Separation reporting and documentation remains employer's responsibility

## 3. State Disability Insurance (SDI) / Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI)

### States with Mandatory Programs

Five U.S. states currently mandate disability insurance programs:

| State | Program Name | Coverage Type |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **California** | State Disability Insurance (SDI) | Short-term disability + Paid Family Leave |
| **Hawaii** | Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) | Short-term disability |
| **New Jersey** | Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) | Short-term + Family Leave |
| **New York** | State Disability Insurance (SDI) | Short-term disability |
| **Rhode Island** | TDI + Temporary Caregiver Insurance (TCI) | Short-term disability + Caregiver leave |

### How SDI/TDI Works

**Funding Structure:**
- Funded through mandatory payroll deductions from employee wages
- Employees contribute a small percentage of gross wages
- Employers may contribute in some states
- Funds are remitted to state disability insurance program

**Benefits Provided:**
- Wage replacement for non-work-related illnesses
- Coverage for work-related pregnancy-related conditions
- Short-term disability benefits (typically 26-52 weeks)
- Paid family leave (in CA, NJ, NY)

### Deel's SDI/TDI Administration

**Deel's Capabilities:**
- Processes mandatory SDI/TDI payroll deductions
- Calculates state-specific rates and limits
- Remits contributions to state agencies
- Ensures compliance with state wage deduction laws
- Integrates SDI withholding with regular payroll processing

**Deel PEO for SDI States:**
- Deel PEO can service employees in SDI states
- Benefits Administration platform coordinates SDI deductions with payroll
- Centralized administration for multi-state employers

**Key Responsibility:** While Deel administers deductions and remittance, employees generally apply for disability benefits directly through state agency portals (EDD in CA, Department of Social Services in NJ, etc.). Deel's role is ensuring accurate withholding and employer compliance.

## Conclusion

Deel provides robust mandatory benefits administration for US employers, particularly excelling at payroll tax compliance, workers' compensation coordination (in non-monopolistic states), and state disability insurance processing. However, organizations must carefully evaluate:

1. **Geographic gaps** in workers' compensation (monopolistic states)
2. **Feature limitations** compared to US-first providers like Gusto
3. **Cost structure** where benefits administration is an add-on
4. **Global integration needs** that justify Deel's international positioning

For organizations with primarily US operations, Gusto may offer better value and simplicity. For companies with international employees or global growth plans, Deel's integrated platform justifies the complexity. The PEO option provides the most comprehensive US mandatory benefits coverage through Deel's co-employer relationship model.
