## Executive Summary

Deel **does support nonprofit organizations** through a dedicated **Social Good program** with significant benefits including free employee onboarding and free contractor management for 12 months.

## 1. Nonprofit-Specific Features & Programs

### 1.1 Deel Social Good Program

Deel offers a structured Social Good program specifically designed for nonprofit organizations:

**Core Program Features:**
- **Free Employee Onboarding:** First two employee hires are completely free using Deel's Employer of Record (EOR) model
- **Free Contractor Services:** Complete contractor management is free for an entire year

- **Global Reach:** Services operate in over 150 countries

**Program Scope:**
The Social Good program targets nonprofits in several sectors:

## 2. Pricing for Nonprofit Organizations

### 2.1 Standard Pricing

**General Deel Pricing Structure:**
- **Contractor Plan:** Starting at $49 per contract per month

**Social Good Program Pricing:**

- **Contractors (Year 1):** FREE for the entire first year
- **After Program Benefits:** No publicly disclosed discounted pricing for continuing services

**Important Finding:** Deel does NOT appear to offer ongoing discounted rates for nonprofits beyond the initial Social Good program benefits. After the free periods expire, nonprofits would likely pay standard Deel pricing.

## 12. Conclusion

Deel **actively supports 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations** through their Social Good program with generous free benefits for the first year of service. The program appears to be genuinely focused on supporting nonprofit missions through global hiring capabilities. However, limited public documentation about verification requirements, long-term pricing, and specific case studies means nonprofits should engage directly with Deel's sales team to understand the full scope of services and costs.

The lack of ongoing discounts after the initial free periods suggests organizations should plan their hiring strategy carefully to maximize the free benefits during year one, as standard Deel pricing will apply afterward.
