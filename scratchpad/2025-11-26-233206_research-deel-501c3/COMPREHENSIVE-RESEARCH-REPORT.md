## Section 5: 501c3 Compliance & Legal Considerations

### IRS & Department of Labor Restrictions

**No Explicit Prohibitions:**
- IRS explicitly allows nonprofits to use third-party payroll providers
- No Department of Labor restrictions on using Deel
- Standard employment law applies equally

### Nonprofit Remains Liable For:
1. **Section 4958 Compliance** - Compensation must be "reasonable"
   - Deel can administer but cannot determine reasonableness
   - Board must independently verify compensation levels
   - Penalty: 25%-200% excise taxes on excess compensation

2. **Private Inurement Doctrine** - No undue benefit to individuals
   - Absolute prohibition on diverting nonprofit earnings
   - Deel provides transparency but nonprofit sets policies

3. **FLSA Compliance** - If applicable
   - Most charitable nonprofits NOT covered by FLSA
   - Nonprofits with $500K+ commercial activities ARE covered
   - Deel can administer but nonprofit must determine coverage

4. **All Employment Taxes**
   - Nonprofit remains ultimately responsible
   - Using Deel doesn't transfer legal liability (except in EOR model)

### International Hiring Requirements

**No Nonprofit Exemptions:**
- Same country-specific employment laws apply
- Each jurisdiction's hiring restrictions must be followed
- Deel helps with compliance but cannot override local law

### Legal Requirements for US 501c3 to Employ Colombian Workers

**Two Pathways:**

#### Option 1: EOR (Recommended for 2 Employees)
- **No legal entity required in Colombia**
- Deel becomes legal employer
- Nonprofit retains operational control
- Setup time: 5 days
- Cost: $599/employee/month

#### Option 2: Direct Employment (Not Recommended)
- **Requires:**
  - Colombian legal entity (SAS, branch, or nonprofit registration)
  - Registration with Chamber of Commerce
  - Tax registration with DIAN
  - Social security registration
  - Colombian bank account
  - Local legal and accounting representation
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks minimum
- **Cost:** $40,000+ setup, $500-1,500/month ongoing compliance

**Compliance Requirements (Both Options):**
- US Side: OFAC sanctions compliance, FCPA anti-corruption, FBAR reporting (if applicable)
- Colombia Side: Labor law, tax withholding, social security, annual audits

### Key Risks & Mitigations

- **Mitigation:** Verify before signing; if unavailable, use separate 403(b) provider or accept 401(k)
- **Cost:** $1,000-3,000/year for separate 403(b) administration

#### Risk 2: Year 2 Cost Increase
- **Impact:** High (from $2,000 to $16,000+ annually)
- **Mitigation:** Plan for Colombian entity establishment during Year 1; budget for transition
- **Benefit:** Year 1 savings fund entity setup costs

#### Risk 3: Workers' Comp Gap (OH, ND, WA, WY)
- **Impact:** Medium (only if US employees in these states)
- **Mitigation:** Purchase directly from state programs; coordinate with Deel for payroll deduction
- **Cost:** State-specific rates (typically $0.75-2.74 per $100 payroll)

#### Risk 4: Compensation Reasonableness (Section 4958)
- **Impact:** High (25%-200% excise taxes if violated)
- **Mitigation:** Board maintains independent compensation review process; use multiple salary surveys
- **Best Practice:** Document decision with comparability data contemporaneously

**Minor Limitations:**
- Less US-focused than domestic specialists (Gusto, ADP)
- Over-engineered for purely domestic operations
- 2% 401(k) match below industry average (4-6% typical)

### Strategic Recommendation: PHASED APPROACH

#### Immediate Action (Year 1)
**Recommendation: Use Deel with Social Good Program**

**Configuration:**
- 2 Colombia employees: EOR via Social Good (FREE)
- 2 US employees: PEO with benefits ($79-95/month each)
- **Year 1 Investment: $1,896-2,280**

**Rationale:**
- Leverage $14,000+ in free EOR value
- Test platform with minimal financial risk
- Achieve immediate Colombian compliance without entity formation
- Comprehensive US benefits through PEO model
- Fast 5-day implementation

**Action Items:**
1. Contact Deel immediately to apply for Social Good program
2. Verify 403(b) availability or plan for 401(k) acceptance
3. Confirm US employee locations (check for OH/ND/WA/WY workers' comp issue)
4. Prepare 501(c)(3) determination letter and verification documents

#### Strategic Decision Point (End of Year 1)

**Evaluate three options based on growth trajectory:**

**Option A: Continue with Deel (If Still 4 Employees, Stable Operations)**
- Year 2+ Cost: $16,512/year
- Best if: Administrative simplicity valued over cost savings
- Drawback: $14,000/year more expensive than Option B

**Option B: Establish Colombian Entity + Transition to Global Payroll (If Cost-Sensitive)**
- Year 2 Setup: $1,000 + legal fees ($2,000-5,000)
- Year 2+ Cost: $922/year (94% reduction!)
- Best if: Willing to accept compliance responsibility for cost savings
- Timeline: Begin entity formation in Month 9 of Year 1

**Option C: Hybrid Approach with Gusto (If Optimizing by Geography)**
- US: Transition to Gusto ($780-960/year)
- Colombia: Continue Deel EOR ($14,376/year)
- Year 2+ Total: $15,156/year
- Best if: US employee benefits dissatisfaction but want Colombian simplicity

**Option D: Scale to Alternative Platform (If Growing to 10+)**
- Consider Rippling for integrated HR/IT at scale
- Establish Colombian entity
- Transition during Month 10-12 of Year 1

### Alternative Consideration: If 403(b) is Non-Negotiable

**If Deel Cannot Provide 403(b):**

**Plan A: Dual-Provider Approach**
- Deel: Payroll processing only ($19/month US + $599/month Colombia EOR)
- Separate 403(b) provider: Employee Fiduciary, Vanguard, or ADP Retirement
- Separate health insurance broker
- **Total Cost: ~$18,000-20,000/year**
- **Drawback:** Multiple platforms, more administrative complexity

**Plan B: Use Oyster or Remote.com**
- Check if they offer 403(b) for nonprofits
- Compare pricing (similar to Deel at $599/month for international)
- Leverage Remote.com's 15% nonprofit discount

**Plan C: US-Only Alternative + Deel Colombia**
- Gusto for US employees (includes 401(k), may have 403(b))
- Deel EOR for Colombia employees only
- **Total Cost: ~$15,000-16,000/year**

### Bottom Line

**Deel is recommended for Year 1** with the Social Good program providing exceptional value ($14,000+ savings). Use Year 1 to:
1. Validate platform capabilities
2. Assess satisfaction with 401(k) vs 403(b)
3. Evaluate Colombian entity formation ROI
4. Test alternatives in parallel
5. Make data-driven Year 2 decision

**The Social Good program essentially provides a FREE pilot year** - this is an exceptional opportunity to test Deel with minimal risk.
