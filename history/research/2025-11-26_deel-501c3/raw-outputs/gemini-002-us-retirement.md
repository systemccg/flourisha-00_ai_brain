# Deel Retirement Benefits for US Nonprofit Employees - Comprehensive Research Report

**Research Date:** November 26, 2025
**Research Question:** Does Deel offer 401(k) or other retirement benefits for US employees at nonprofits?

---

## Executive Summary

Deel offers **401(k) retirement plans** through multiple service models (EOR, PEO, and direct payroll), but specific **403(b) retirement plans for 501(c)(3) nonprofits are not documented** in available sources. Deel provides mandatory 2% employer matching for EOR clients, integrates with Fidelity as the primary plan administrator, and offers comprehensive benefits administration through its payroll platform. However, nonprofits seeking 403(b) plans (which are tax-advantaged specifically for nonprofits) should verify directly with Deel whether such options exist.

## 2. Nonprofit-Specific Retirement Options (403(b))

### Critical Finding: No Documented 403(b) Offering

**Based on comprehensive search results, no evidence was found that Deel currently offers 403(b) tax-sheltered annuity plans specifically for 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations.**

### Why 403(b) Matters for Nonprofits
- 403(b) plans are **exclusive to public schools and 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations**
- A 401(k) can be offered by nearly any company type (for-profit or nonprofit)
- Many nonprofits prefer 403(b) due to tax treatment and regulatory fit
- **Source:** [403(b) vs 401(k): Comparing retirement plans for nonprofits | Human Interest](https://humaninterest.com/learn/articles/403b-compared-to-401k-retirement-plans-for-non-profits/)

### Alternative Nonprofit Providers
Research revealed these companies actively offer 403(b) plans for nonprofits:
- Human Interest
- Vestwell
- Fidelity (403(b) division)
- ForUsAll
- Employee Fiduciary
- PenServ
- Ameritas
- Mutual of America

**None of these results mentioned Deel as a 403(b) provider.**

### Recommendation for Nonprofits
Organizations with 501(c)(3) status may:
1. **Confirm with Deel directly** whether 403(b) support is available
2. **Consider Deel's 401(k) option** for nonprofits (which is legally permissible, though less common)
3. **Evaluate alternative providers** specializing in 403(b) for nonprofits

## 6. Special Considerations for Nonprofit Organizations

### Current Limitations
1. **No 403(b) Documentation:** No evidence Deel offers 403(b) plans (preferred for nonprofits)
2. **401(k) Viability:** Nonprofits can legally use 401(k) plans but uncommon
3. **Mandatory 2% Match (EOR):** Fixed rate may not align with nonprofit budgeting flexibility

### Nonprofit-Specific Recommendations

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Using Deel EOR** | Confirm 401(k) setup is available; verify 2% match aligns with nonprofit budget |
| **Using Deel PEO** | Contact Deel directly about 403(b) vs. 401(k) options and match flexibility |
| **403(b) Requirement** | Evaluate specialized providers: Human Interest, Vestwell, Fidelity 403(b) division |
| **Hybrid Approach** | Consider Deel payroll + third-party 403(b) provider integration |

### Questions to Ask Deel (Direct Outreach)
1. Does Deel offer 403(b) plans for 501(c)(3) organizations?
2. Are there nonprofit-specific retirement benefit packages?
3. Can the 2% EOR match be waived or modified for nonprofits?
4. Does Deel integrate with third-party 403(b) providers?
5. What compliance support is available specifically for nonprofit plan sponsors?

---

## 7. Regulatory and Compliance Context

### ERISA Requirements
- **Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA):** Governs retirement plan administration
- **Compliance Obligation:** US employers must regularly update workers about benefits options
- **Deel's Role:** Handles compliance, state registration, tax filings, and regulatory monitoring
- **Source:** [Employee benefits | Deel](https://www.deel.com/glossary/employee-benefits/)

### IRS Filings and State Compliance
