## 2. How the Deel Colombia EOR Model Works

### The Legal Employment Structure

**Deel's Role (as Employer of Record):**
1. Signs employment contracts as the local legal employer under its Colombian entity
2. Registers each employee with pension, health insurance (EPS), labor-risk insurance, and family-compensation systems
3. Becomes the statutory employer bearing all legal liability
4. Processes payroll and manages all tax/social security obligations
5. Maintains required labor files and workplace-safety registers

**Your Company's Role (as Client):**
1. Directs day-to-day work activities, KPIs, and company culture
2. Manages operational tasks and performance expectations
3. Retains decision-making authority on hiring, management, and termination
4. Receives one consolidated monthly invoice in USD from Deel

### The Compliance Absorption Model

**Regulatory Liability Transfer:**
- If the Colombian tax authority (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales - DIAN) audits
- If Colombian labor inspectors conduct workplace reviews
- **Liability sits with Deel (the EOR), not with the hiring company**

This is the core value of the EOR model—the employer-of-record assumes all statutory employer obligations and audit risk.

### Operational Timeline

| Phase | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Initial Setup with Deel | 1-5 business days |
| Employee Onboarding | 1 business day average |
| First Payroll Processing | 5-10 days after onboarding |
| Full Compliance Setup | Concurrent with onboarding |

**Comparison to Direct Entity Setup:**
- Direct Colombian entity formation: 16-28 weeks
- Deel EOR onboarding: Under 5 days
- **Time savings: 320% faster**
