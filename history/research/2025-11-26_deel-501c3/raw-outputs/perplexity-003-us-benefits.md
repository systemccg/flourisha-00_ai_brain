## 7. Key Considerations for US Employees

### Important Notes

1. **Employment Classification:** Some employee reviews indicate that only executives are hired as full-time employees with benefits, while other positions may be contractors. Benefits eligibility depends on employment classification.

2. **Unlimited PTO Culture:** While unlimited PTO is offered, actual usage depends on manager and company culture. Employees should clarify expectations during hiring.

3. **Health Insurance Cost Sharing:** The research did not reveal specific employee cost-sharing details (deductibles, copays, out-of-pocket maximums). These should be clarified during benefits enrollment.

4. **Retirement Adequacy:** The 2% 401(k) match is relatively low. Employees should plan additional retirement savings to meet retirement goals.

5. **State-Specific Benefits:** Employees in certain states (CA, NJ, WA, NY, DE) may be eligible for state-mandated paid family leave in addition to Deel's benefits.

6. **Benefits for Contractors:** If employed as an independent contractor, standard benefits like health insurance and 401(k) may not be available. Only full-time employees receive full benefits packages.

## Conclusion

Deel offers a comprehensive benefits package for US-based employees that combines competitive health coverage, generous parental leave, unlimited PTO, and various supplementary benefits. The company is recognized as a competitive employer with strong ratings on review platforms. However, prospective and current employees should be aware of:

1. The 2% 401(k) match is below industry average
2. Unlimited PTO effectiveness depends on company culture and manager support
3. Employment classification determines benefits eligibility
4. State-specific benefits may provide additional protections

Overall, Deel's benefits package is well-suited for remote workers and internationally-focused employees, with particular strength in parental leave and flexible work arrangements.
