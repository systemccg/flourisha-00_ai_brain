## 6. Colombian Labor Law Summary - Key Points for Deel Implementation

### 6.1 Employment Contract Types

1. **Indefinite Contracts:** Default type; severe severance consequences for termination without cause
2. **Fixed-Term Contracts:** Must specify end date; indemnification to contract end
3. **Specific Project/Service Contracts:** Tied to project completion; minimum 15-day indemnification

### 6.2 Termination Types

**Termination With Just Cause (Article 62):**
- No severance indemnity required
- Still must pay accrued benefits (cesantías, interest, vacation)
- Notice requirement: 15 days for certain specified causes

**Termination Without Just Cause:**
- Full severance indemnity per employee salary bracket
- Full cesantías and interest payment
- Vacation payout for all accrued but untaken vacation
- Notice generally not required

### 6.3 Mandatory Benefits Timeline

| Benefit | Frequency | Employer Obligation |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Monthly Salary | Monthly | Full amount plus benefits |
| Pension Contribution (Cesantías) | Monthly | 1 month salary per year, deposited by Feb 14 |
| Social Security | Monthly | Via PILA system |
| 13th Month Bonus | Twice yearly | Jan 31 (50%) + Dec 20 (50%) |
| Annual Vacation | Yearly | 15 working days minimum |
| Public Holidays | 18 annually | Full day's pay |

### 6.4 Minimum Wage and Ceiling Calculations

### 6.5 Contractor Misclassification Risk

Colombian courts regularly re-characterize independent contractors as employees, resulting in:
- Back-pay orders for unpaid benefits
- Social security contribution penalties
- Severance indemnity obligations

Deel's EOR model directly addresses this by employing workers directly.
