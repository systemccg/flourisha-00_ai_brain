---

---

### 3.3 Break-Even Analysis

#### Financial Break-Even Point

**Key Variables:**
- Direct employment annual overhead: $6,000 - $18,000 (accounting, legal, compliance)
- Deel fee per employee: $599/month ($7,188/year)
- Employer contribution rate: 45% of base salary
- Average Colombian salary: $4,800 - $6,000/year base

**Break-Even Calculation:**

The break-even occurs when the per-employee cost of direct employment (salary + benefits + prorated overhead) equals Deel's $599/month fee.

- **At 1 employee**: Deel is superior (40-50% cost savings)
- **At 5 employees**: Deel is superior (39-46% cost savings)
- **At 10-15 employees**: Cost approaches parity; Deel still advantageous
- **At 20+ employees**: Direct employment becomes slightly more economical

**Mathematical Break-Even:** Approximately 25-35 employees in a single location, assuming:
- Average salary: $500-700/month
- Fixed compliance overhead: $500-750/month
- Both approaches handle full payroll

---

#### Strategic Break-Even Point (Non-Financial)

Beyond pure numbers, consider:

1. **Time to Market**: Deel hires in 5 days vs. 16-28 weeks for entity setup
   - Cost of delayed hiring: Potentially $5,000-20,000 in lost productivity

2. **Compliance Risk**: Direct employment carries higher regulatory risk
   - Penalties for misclassification: Up to $1.58 million USD
   - Deel's compliance guarantee reduces this risk

3. **Operational Complexity**: Managing payroll increases significantly with more employees
   - Deel handles all compliance; direct approach requires dedicated HR/finance

4. **Currency Risk**: Deel handles COP/USD currency management
   - Direct approach requires managing foreign exchange directly

---

## Part 4: Key Cost Drivers and Considerations

### 4.1 Factors Favoring Direct Employment

1. **Large Stable Teams**: 25+ employees in stable roles
2. **Long-term Commitment**: 3+ year employment horizon per employee
3. **High-volume Operations**: Need for multiple staff members in Colombia
4. **Fixed Office Location**: Planning to establish physical presence
5. **Maturity of Operations**: Well-established company with HR infrastructure

---

### 4.2 Factors Favoring Deel EOR

1. **Speed to Hire**: Need to onboard within days, not weeks
2. **Small Teams**: 1-10 employees
3. **Distributed Hiring**: Multiple countries or uncertain geographic presence

5. **Operational Simplicity**: Don't want to manage local HR/payroll
6. **Cost Sensitivity**: Budget constraints for initial operations
7. **Temporary/Contract Roles**: Short-term or project-based positions

---

### 4.3 Hidden Costs in Direct Employment Approach

- **HR/Finance Staff**: Need dedicated person once team grows (salary, benefits)
- **Software Systems**: HRIS, payroll, accounting software licenses
- **Regulatory Changes**: Compliance updates and new regulation implementation
- **Legal Liability**: Potential fines for non-compliance (up to $1.58M for misclassification)

---

### 8.2 Documentation and Compliance Requirements (Direct Employment)

---

## Conclusion and Recommendations

### Cost Differential Summary

1. **Small Operations (1-5 employees)**: Deel is **40-50% cheaper**
2. **Medium Operations (5-15 employees)**: Deel is **15-35% cheaper**
3. **Large Operations (20+ employees)**: Deel is **10-20% cheaper**

   - Validate market and team requirements
   - Test product-market fit in Colombia
   - Build operational experience with local hiring
   - Cost: $599/employee/month

2. **Phase 2 (Months 12-24)**: Evaluate transition decision
   - If 20+ stable employees: Transition to direct employment
   - If fewer employees: Continue with Deel or hybrid model
   - Cost savings if transitioning: 10-15% annually

3. **Phase 3 (24+ months)**: Optimize structure
   - Direct employment for stable Colombia operations
   - Deel for temporary/contract positions
   - Dedicated HR/Finance for compliance
   - Target steady-state cost reduction: 10-35% depending on scale

### Key Success Factors

1. **Tax Compliance**: Colombian tax laws are complex; Deel significantly reduces this risk
2. **Speed**: For rapidly growing companies, Deel's 5-day onboarding is critical
