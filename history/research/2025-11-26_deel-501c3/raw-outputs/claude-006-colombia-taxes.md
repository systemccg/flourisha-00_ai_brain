## 2. Income Tax Withholding (Retención en la Fuente)

Retención en la Fuente (income tax withholding) is an advance tax collection mechanism ensuring compliance with annual tax obligations. Employers must withhold income tax from monthly salaries, which serves as an advance payment on the employee's annual income tax liability.

Employers calculate taxable income by applying deductions and exemptions:

- **Submission frequency:** Monthly
- **Reporting deadline:** Varies based on employer's NIT
- **Payment requirement:** Withheld amounts must be paid to DIAN monthly
