# Daily Roadmap - 2025-12-05

## 🎯 THE ONE THING
**Test and validate the daily-roadmap skill in real usage**

This is today's critical focus. The skill was just built - now it needs to be used to verify it works and iterate on improvements.

## ⚡ CRITICAL PATH
1. Use daily-roadmap skill (happening now)
2. Validate output format meets needs
3. Identify any missing context sources

## 📋 TIERED PRIORITIES

### Tier 1: Must Complete
- [x] Create daily-roadmap skill (DONE)
- [x] Test "start my day" trigger (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Review Daron Vener insights → decide what else to implement from his system

### Tier 2: If Time Permits
- [ ] Add productivity-assessment skill (end-of-day counterpart)
- [ ] Enhance session history hooks to capture richer context
- [ ] Update CORE skill with knowledge RAG reference

### Tier 3: Can Defer
- [ ] Integrate Graphiti/Neo4j for deeper context retrieval
- [ ] Build brutal-prioritization skill
- [ ] Create strategic knowledge base (AI Growth Engine equivalent)

## 🔗 CONTINUITY

**From Current Session:**
- Extracted wisdom from Daron Vener's Claude Code productivity video
- Built daily-roadmap skill based on his "2-minute planning" principle
- Created PROJECT_REGISTRY.md to track active projects
- Key insight: "1 minute to launch, 1 minute to read" = sustainable discipline

**Active Projects Requiring Attention:**
| Project | Priority | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| flourisha-enhancements | HIGH | Just added daily-roadmap |
| flourisha-app | HIGH | Backend development |
| Content_Intelligence | HIGH | Integration work |

## 🎲 EXECUTION STRATEGY

**Morning Block (Now):**
- Complete daily-roadmap validation
- Review what worked, note improvements
- Decide on next Daron Vener insight to implement

**Focus Block:**
- If daily-roadmap is solid → move to productivity-assessment skill
- Alternatively: Continue flourisha-app backend work

**End of Day:**
- Test productivity-assessment (if built)
- Or manually reflect on what got done vs. plan

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

Today is successful if:
1. Daily-roadmap skill works reliably with "start my day" trigger
2. Output format is useful and scannable
3. Clear decision made on next productivity skill to build
4. At least one session ends with roadmap saved to history/roadmaps/
