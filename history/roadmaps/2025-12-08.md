# Daily Roadmap - 2025-12-08

## 🎯 THE ONE THING
**Continue flourisha-app backend development** - This is the most recently active HIGH priority project with momentum from Dec 6.

## ⚡ CRITICAL PATH
1. Review flourisha-app backend current state (agents, auth, models, routers, services)
2. Determine next implementation milestone
3. Connect Content_Intelligence processing to flourisha-app

## 📋 TIERED PRIORITIES

### Tier 1: Must Complete
- [ ] Review flourisha-app backend architecture and identify gaps
- [ ] Define clear next milestone for flourisha-app (what feature/endpoint to build next)
- [ ] Ensure backend services are running and testable

### Tier 2: If Time Permits
- [ ] Content_Intelligence integration work (HIGH priority per registry)
- [ ] Document flourisha-app progress with CONTEXT.md
- [ ] Update PROJECT_REGISTRY.md with current status

### Tier 3: Can Defer
- [ ] docker-sandbox-template testing refinement
- [ ] flourisha-enhancements / PAI skill improvements
- [ ] Review on-hold projects for any unblocked items

## 🔗 CONTINUITY
**From Recent Sessions:**
- Session logs are minimal (hook stubs) - consider improving session capture
- flourisha-app had activity Dec 6 (backend/ with agents, auth, models, routers, services)
- Content_Intelligence updated Dec 5
- No detailed session notes captured - opportunity to improve history hooks

**Active Projects per Registry:**
| Project | Priority | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| flourisha-app | HIGH | Backend development |
| Content_Intelligence | HIGH | Integration work |
| flourisha-enhancements | MEDIUM | PAI improvements |
| docker-sandbox-template | MEDIUM | Testing phase |

## 🎲 EXECUTION STRATEGY
1. **Morning (Deep Work):** Focus on flourisha-app backend review and coding
2. **Identify Blockers:** If unclear on next steps, define milestones first
3. **Document as You Go:** Create CONTEXT.md files for projects lacking them
4. **End of Day:** Update PROJECT_REGISTRY with progress

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Clear understanding of flourisha-app current state
- [ ] At least one meaningful feature/endpoint implemented or advanced
- [ ] PROJECT_REGISTRY updated with today's progress
- [ ] Optional: Content_Intelligence integration planning documented
