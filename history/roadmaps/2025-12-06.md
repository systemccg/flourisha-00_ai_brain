# Daily Roadmap - 2025-12-06

## 🎯 THE ONE THING
**Continue flourisha-app development** - The backend is the core platform that all other projects depend on. Neo4j knowledge graph and vector embeddings are the critical next features.

## ⚡ CRITICAL PATH
1. Neo4j/Graphiti knowledge graph integration (blocks content intelligence features)
2. Vector embeddings setup in Supabase (blocks semantic search)
3. Content_Intelligence integration with flourisha-app backend

## 📋 TIERED PRIORITIES

### Tier 1: Must Complete
- [ ] Design Neo4j integration approach for flourisha-app
- [ ] Set up Graphiti memory layer for knowledge graph
- [ ] Test backend API endpoints (17 existing endpoints need validation)

### Tier 2: If Time Permits
- [ ] Add vector embeddings to Supabase (PG Vector)
- [ ] Content_Intelligence - wire up to backend processing pipeline
- [ ] Docker-sandbox-template testing refinements

### Tier 3: Can Defer
- [ ] Mobile app development (React Native)
- [ ] Background processing worker implementation
- [ ] File storage (PARA) integration

## 🔗 CONTINUITY
**Recent Context (Dec 5):** Heavy research session on:
- Chart/OCR extraction tools (ChartOCR, Google DePlot, MatCha models)
- PDF processing comparison (PyMuPDF, Tesseract, PaddleOCR vs EasyOCR)
- Vision LLM capabilities (Claude 3.5/4 vs GPT-4V for chart analysis)

This research feeds directly into Content_Intelligence - processing charts/graphs/PDFs from documents and YouTube videos.

**Project Status:**
- flourisha-app: Backend API working (17 endpoints), needs Neo4j + embeddings
- Content_Intelligence: Ready for integration
- docker-sandbox-template: Testing phase
- PAI skills (flourisha-enhancements): daily-roadmap skill just added

## 🎲 EXECUTION STRATEGY
1. **Morning (Deep Work):** Neo4j/Graphiti design and initial integration
2. **Midday:** Backend API testing, vector embeddings planning
3. **Afternoon:** Content_Intelligence integration work
4. **End of Day:** Document progress, update PROJECT_REGISTRY.md

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Neo4j integration plan documented and started
- [ ] At least one major feature (graph OR embeddings) progressed significantly
- [ ] Backend API validated working
- [ ] Clear path forward for Content_Intelligence integration
