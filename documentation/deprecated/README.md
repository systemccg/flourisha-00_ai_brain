## Why These Are Deprecated

These documents are kept in the deprecated folder because they:

1. **E2B Phase 1** - Replaced by Phase 2 Docker sandboxes offering unlimited runtime and zero cost
2. **One-time integrations** - Describe completed migrations or system merges no longer actively being performed
3. **Temporary solutions** - Document solutions that were valid at the time but have been superseded

## When to Read This Folder

You may want to review these documents if:
- You need historical context on how systems were integrated
- You're researching previous approaches to problems
- You need to understand the evolution of the system
- You're documenting a deprecation

## Going Forward

For current guidance, refer to:
- **Phase 2 Docker Sandboxes:** [../phase2/](../phase2/)
- **Current Architecture:** [../FLOURISHA_AI_ARCHITECTURE.md](../FLOURISHA_AI_ARCHITECTURE.md)
