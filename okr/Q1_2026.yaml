# Notes and Context
# ============================================================================
notes: |
  This is the foundational quarter for Flourisha AI Brain Phase 1.

  The goal is to establish the basic operating rhythm across all 4 departments:

  1. Strategic Command: Daily roadmaps and weekly reviews
  2. Knowledge Intelligence: Email and contact intelligence
  3. Execution Agents: Task automation and workflows
  4. System Evolution: Temporal agent experimentation

  Success means building sustainable habits and infrastructure that will
  compound in future quarters. Focus on consistency over perfection.

  Measurement is weekly with progress updates persisted to Supabase for
  historical trending and pattern analysis.
